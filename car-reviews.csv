On the exterior, the front look of this car is the best in its category. However, the back is a little bit odd, but the tail lights should be on the trunk. Overall, I liked its exterior. In the interior, the dashboard is very beautiful especially dual tone. It has practical and safety features such as power windows, retractable-adjustable side mirrors, LCD, dual airbags, and ABS brakes. Let's move on to the engine specs, it has an R-series 660cc engine which is capable of producing  39 hp and 56 nm torque. While driving, this car has optimal power. Never felt underpowered with 4 to 5 passengers. It has decent pick and engine response.  As we talk we talk about its comfort, it is outclass especially the front seats. The back seat comfort can be improved by adding 2 headrests to it, but the cushioning is very soft so I will add a plus point to it. The ride quality is very smooth and the handling is also. My final verdict is that you have to purchase this  car even it cost 3 million

But i have my real concerns which need to be told to general public. Although the Invoice states its 2023 Model but the label on my Seat Belts and the year of manufacture on car Tyres is  of 2022.Car's  Water Pump/Water Body has turned out to be faulty. Which i have claimed in warranty.Car's CVT  transmission is making a hissing noise upon gear shift which is very irritating to hear. It needs to be checked.Car's front Windscreen is bubbly from the bottom which gives a distorted vision.Car has an extremely beautiful interior but the company has used hard quality plastic all around. The rear doors look like  that of a toy car.I am in negotiations with Suzuki Pakistan Motors  to address my issues. They are really Supportive and helpful.

The best hatchback when it comes to locally assembled cars. Its exterior is a work of art, simply beautiful.Interior is spacious, both seating wise and for ornaments and stuff. 5 persons can easily adjust for an intra-city drive but for longer journeys, 4 persons are recommended.Performance is the best part. Brakes, road grip, handling, stability, acceleration, speed, power, everything is better than other hatchbacks. Touching 180 is a piece of cake. 13-16 is its fuel mileage with A/C (manual). Automatic gives less mileage. The tank is of 42L.Manufacturing faults: Rear wheel bearing noise, misaligned hood.Things I don't like: Total cheap plastic interior, no airbags, pathetic infotainment, hard seats, no height adjustment.Things I like: Overall road performance (especially stability and brakes), and exterior.

Look wise Suzuki Swift is a good car. It looks good only when it is in other hands. Reality comes after you buy. I bought Suzuki Swift for & I received it on 6th Jan. Since day 1 its AC was not working. I submitted the complaint to dealership and Suzuki Customer Service Center. Dealership called the vehicle for inspection and upon inspection they told me that its AC condenser is damaged. I asked them to cover this in warranty as at that time vehicle was brand new and used for few hundreds KMs only. Initially Pak Suzuki Denied for Warranty Claim but later Dealership told me that  Pak Suzuki has approved request to cover damages for broken part under warranty and they will provide me Replacement part once available. But later on 31st March Dealership called me and told me that I will not get replacement part as Pak Suzuki has again denied the request for Warranty Claim. Better not to buy any car from Suzuki Swift. Suzuki is a group of thugs and fraudsters.

I saw alot of accident in which, this car frame has fully broken. when you drive this car ???? there is a noice comes out from it's engine ""baaaaaaaaa"" so it's seems like the engine in blast in a minute. so if you guys are looking for a daily revin car so i suggest you to purchase suzuki wagon rather then par chasing suzuki alto. wagon is 1000cc & its not have a negative review as alto.so  wagor is much better than Alto. and it's value to money as well.

Exterior is fine. Although I am strongly disagree with this vehicle. I feature this car by myself, it's underpowered. however it started vibrating on high speed 120. soundproofing is extremely bad whenever you highref the car there is sound i hear baaaaaa baaaa which is not good. so in my opinion it's not value to money. i sugget you guys to purchase wagonr in the budget of 2.9 millon rather then par chasing shapar

I like the overall look of the exterior but it would've been much if they would have given a rear spoiler and wiper. I have only kept the car for 1 week and the fuel tank cap has started getting jammed. The interior is okay but the  manual window's lever is of really cheap quality as only with little force , the whole door panel started shaking and looks like as if the whole thing is about to break apart. Instead of all that, I pretty much like the car..

Have Suzuki Alto since 2021. Used it for every purpose, for long routes and city. Car is good in Fuel Economy, whereas the issues with Built Quality are more, ride Quality is Inferior compared to other cars. Handling is OK, while leg space is also good. But Overall some basic features like Adjustable Steering and Rear Headrest could be given, which I really feel missing in my Car. The car's AGS gearbox is a bit Jerky which could be made better. After 50k, the Lack and Shifts are delayed very much.  Overall I've kept it for better fuel efficiency and maneuverability. Its not recommended to take this car on long routes, as car although is reliable but is way too Underpowered for highway Travelling.

And also pakwheels auto store is very reliable for the parts of all the cars we can get all the parts easily especially for me for alto and others too.

It has strong body strong body structure than new model Alto. Seats are comfortable. It is an ideal car for Long Drive, very comfortable  drive and journey on Motorways. AC is working good in this 660cc as well. Heater works. Further you can add more accessories in it and make it decorated to make its loo k so dashing. My car has fuel average in city is 13 to 15 and on long drive it goes to 17 to 20 KM/L.My car has DVR installed with reverse camera.

101,2017 Suzuki Ciaz Automatic,4," Jul 09, 2022","

After using this vehicle for 5 years with 100k+ on the odometer, I am writing its review here. The car is unbelievably comfortable and offers almost the same features as a brand new honda city. In 2017, I had the option to buy a city or a corolla but I went with the newly launched Ciaz. Now in 2022, I booked a City 2022 CVT but after the drive, I was truly disappointed and decided to keep my Ciaz for the new few years. The vehicle lacks some basic features such as alloy rims, steering controls, LCD with back Cam, and fog lights but these things are easily available in the market at a very cheap price. Talking about the fuel average, it easily give me 14kmpl in city and 17-18 kmpl on long routes which is one of the best in it's class. Even today it's a very good car to be considered and these vehicles are available in the market with cheap prices and low mileage. Parts availability isn't an issue but yes they are a bit expensive as compared to corolla and city.

i owned alto VXR 2020, i loved the car for fuel economy ( as i used to get 20 to 21 kmpl with AC for daily 20 to 30 km commute). Driving position and comfort was a plus too, though noisy cabin (mainly engine noise though you get used to it, if its your daily driver) and manual windows were a let down and the biggest was non abs brakes. Sold it after10 months and booked picanto manual , what a car it is excellent.It used to  give me 14 kmpl on same route with AC. Booked Swift GL, Better than picanto in space, emgine is very smooth, it doesnot vibrate like picanto on 1.5 rpm in 3rd and 4th gear. the car has Vehicle stability. Gear shift and clutch are light like picanto. It is returning 17 kmpl (Will get better when car clocks 5000 kms on odo) on same route on which alto and picanto recorded 20 to 21 and 14 to 15 respectively. Would have been better if a manual variant is also launched in GLX or at least give back camera , back speakers in GL variant too Pak Suzuki

The vehicle has a decent shape, we had a white colour and being a Suzuki, it did well in our seven years use. Its interior and exterior remained original, suspension needed to be re-coated though other than that, it accumulated rust on the lower edges of  the wheel arches of the vehicle rear. I think that as far as fuel average is concerned, it was 18 but this benefit got reduced when air or oil filter had to be changed. Their cost is triple than similar parts that are used for P.K.D.M. vehicles Moreover, without Hi-Octane being filled twice a month, it's engine used to knock. Mechanics charge high rate for repairing a sophisticated car and only select mechanics can deal with problems arising in. Ours needed A.C. and steering repair and it cost us 60,000.Therefore, as far as cost saving is concerned, P.K.D.M. vehicles are much better, they can deal with mineral oil. This Alto on the other hand can do well with synthetic oil only.

You have to compare it with Toyota Raize or Daihatsu Rocky. As these cars price is higher and cost above 4 million pkr but xbee price is lesser and it cost around 3 to 3.5 millions pkr and having same horse power and torque and features. so i think its value to money So my final decision is you should go and buy it and experience its power only in 1000cc engine

swift SEEMS TO BE  very good addition in the family of hatchback cars, but I think its too late to launch this car  because  various other cars are already in the market.  Previous  Liana Engine was installed in the previous model which was very heavy on fuel, now 1200 CC engine has come up due to Honda city  providing same CC. Alsvin  has already captured market with sedan shape and numerous features and superb quality. New swift would have been launched with Hybrid engine to become exclusive in technology and would have attracted the customer even with more price but brand new hybrid car manufactured in Pakistan.  Customers have realized that they are using Chinese spare parts in Japanese cars so its better to buy Chinese car instead of locally assembled Japanese low quality cars with very expensive spare parts.  Clear perception prevails that Chinese cargo vehicles have already captured market and now cars are getting inn with wide range of SUVs. swif  1200 CC  total failure.

Owned this car for one year. It’s quite good in pick ana acceleration because it has big engine in compact size. It’s a pocket rocket you can say. Brakes are also good because it has ABS system. Suspension os soft and decent. Ac performance is great as well as the ground clearance. It’s leg room in also decent considering it’s a hatchback so a 6 feet person can easily fit in the back seat if front seats are not fully reclined. The only issue is the poor fuel economy of this car hardly gives 10-11 per litre in city without AC. If you’re looking for luxury you can own it but if fuel economy is your preference than rather switch to some other option.

I bought Wagon R VXL in 2014 when it was launched. To be frank, at that time and at that price range 1090k it was the best car in that range. It's been more than 7 years I've been driving this car now, and I can say with confidence that it was the best decision i made. Still sfter 7 years of driving, it gives 14-15km mileage in city (with AC) it's AC is outstanding, maintenance cost is as low as 3-3.5k even now after 7years. O haven't changed anything till now in my Wagon R agyer 7 years of driving. All things still intact and working perfectly. That shows its really worth the money. Now it prices upto 2 million which i believe is unjustified, but when i bought it was 1 Million, and was totally worth it.

Aoa I Have Suzuki Alto Vxr 2006 model. We want to buy a small hatchback car for family. We searched for Cultus, Santro, Cours & Alto and at last bought alto. Now we all are happy with this car. This is a good car. There are only two minus points of this car 1st. is Bad fuel average and 2nd. is expensive spare parts. That's main negative points of this car, because in this budget of 4-6 lacks most people have to buy a car with good fuel avg and low price parts and this car has these negative points, and mehran have very very good  fuel average and spare parts are????... But if you can afford its expense then its a very good car especially it's AC Is very chilled, interior is made up of good plastic, and it's a simple car. Megran don't have AC, Alto have AC, mehran is 800cc, alto is 1000cc, Engine performance is also good if the car os maintained well.. It is a good budget car but only fuel average is the minus point!!! It's a beautiful,stylish car also.

When i was first going to buy this car i saw many people talking about different issues and company's faults. But I trust Allah and purchased this car and now I'm so happy. I personally inspect my car from every single inch and I won't be able to find a single company's fault. The Exterior is Good as well as Interior and the engine performance is average bcz its a city car and you can't expect a higher engine performance. The average it's giving me 13 to 14 km/l but it depends on person to person on how you drive but overall its value for money. If you are going for picanto the 3 main issues on that car are 1. Delivery takes too much time after booking process. 2. The average is not good as compare to Cultus. 3. High prices of Parts and availability issues. I inspect every single car but i found this one value for Money and even after booking company delivers my car in just 1 month isn't that amazing. I hope my Review help you.

As per my calculation the car gives 8 - 8.5 km/l in city or may be less if driven with heavy foot, never driven on CNG.Suspensions are soft and not much on harder side.Performance wise the car is not too much overpowered niether underpowered and the engine provides optimum power for in-city driving.Air conditioner of this car is upto the mark and I'll rate it 10/10.Parts are easily available and are very much affordable.We bought this car for 450k back in 2017 and then sold it out for 530k in 2021.if we consider other options available in market under 500k I think this is a great car for family use although the fuel average might annoy you.

I have put it through 65,000 of broken kilometers  of roads between Hyderabad and Sukhur and so far it has proved words of Ali Khan about Mehran a lie. Over this period I have spent only PKR 4,500  over suspension and engine seals as well as foundation. I suspect a feat that neither Cherry QQ or any other Chinese box could achieve. I would buy a newer Mehran any day, because I know I don't want to look good but go for product that offers utility and Mehran does that.

Bearing traditional looks the car is excellent vehicle that could be kept for ten to fifteen years without needing an overhaul. So far since 2017 we have run it over 41,000 kilometers over rough roads between Hyderabad, Mirpurkhaas  and Diplo. However, the car has still retained its original suspension parts as well as other mechanical parts and we only have to spend on its regular oil change. However, it is heavy on fuel and gives about 13 in city while 15 on highway, other than that car is better than V2 or Picanto.

The car is decent in looks has common features though the led response is just fine in the price and has a few glitches.The acceleration is decent can outrun a gli 1.3 and it's competitor picanto.The car is stiff not good in comfort for fuel average.The tires are hard which you can change for comfort and acceleration. The groun clearance is good can carry decent wait and won't fail you also the breaking is as good as its acceleration.Can do 0 to 100 in 13 seconds and top speed is also good. can keep up with other local cars at high speed.The front fenders are bad quality compared to other body parts.The ac is good in price range but won't work good for people in 2nd row in high temperature as 41 42.Can handle beating and can be used rough.It is value of money but could had some improvement in features

A great car to drive. The exterior is sporty and good looking and I liked the interior too. The build quality is just average and the new infotainment screen looks pretty stylish. The leg room can be a problem in the back seats but I think that's manageable. While driving the suspension is average and can feel stiff at times. The thing I love about this car is it's performance. The 1.3 litre DOHC engine doesn't let down in providing a fun drive especially if you get the manual transmission one. The car accelerates quickly when floored. However, the fuel average is on the lower side, I usually got 9-10. Highly recommend for an enthusiast who wants maximum power while driving. But as a daily family car, I don't think it's the best option. I personally love this car.

Alhamdulillah, this is my second consecutive WagonR VXL. The new WagonR VXL comes with alloy rims and new infotainment system. I preferred it over Cultus and Picanto. The wagonR is more practical for urban traveling with traffic jams and uneven roads and speed breakers. Hopefully this new WagonR will insha'Allah be performing well. If Suzuki could give ABS in WagonR then it would be better. About resale value: the WagonR MashaAllah sells like a hot cake. Matain your car through 3S dealers. It gives 14km/liter with AC in city with light foot and gear shitfting at 2.5k RPM. On motorways it can give upto 18+km/liter with high.octane mixed with petrol in 2:5 or 1:4 ratio. Suzuki sells the spare parts (air & oil filters) at gold rates so get the Guard Air filter, Mehran oil filter and genuine oil (Suzuki oil) to be ecnomical. Use the General Tycoon tyres. The car is overall spacious and reliable. Cultus and Picanto are overly priced and have almost same space and features.

I used to change oil and filter after every 3000 kms.and it costed me below 3000  rupees. Only annoying thing was its rattling sound on rouhh roads. yes its AC is not bad.

The exterior feels too light so there's no guaranteeing survival in a car crash. The interior is relatively better with ample leg room for it's size. Steering wheel height cannot be adjusted. Trunk space is next to nothing and there's no spare tyre. Seats are kind of hard and not good for long distance travelling. Driving at or over 100 kmph speed causes it to start vibrating uncontrollably and handling is mediocre at best. It doesn't even have rear speakers. Only commendable part is that it has an excellent fuel average. It's definitely a car better suited to within city travel and taking it out on the motorways might just be a death wish. Finally, the price tag associated with the car is definitely not worth the trouble and hopefully, increasing competition in the local car market might help tone it down a notch since nothing about the car says its worth 17 lakh rupees.

I have mehran 2014 euro 2 the things I like about the car are the fuel avg,cheap maintainance and cheap parts.The car has build quality issues and sounds come from the doors and suspension and the suspension have to be changed after 3 to 4 years overall the engine is perfect with good power.The Ac of the car is good for one person but not for two people as it only has 2 vents and it stops working on very hot days in karachi.park the car in shade as the color fades if it is kept in sunlight.overall good car for a beginner but i wouldn't recommend to older people as you will get tired while driving and every single bump will be felt.

they could have made the exterior of this car more stylish and sturdy because of the price slab it falls in is near premium. interior of the car is good as compared to previous versions and mehran who it has replaced.

I would say the least that it is a premium plus budget car that has replaced the decade old mehran and alto.

Exterior is a bit sporty and simple with a fairly good build quality. The body, chassis and suspension are good; which contribute to good road grip. Interior is simple with good build quality. A/C is fine and works well in Karachi's weather. The roof insulation is better which enhances A/C performance. The seats are of great quality and offer a comfortable commute. The worst part of Suzuki Cultus are the General tyres. I replaced and installed Dunlop SP Sport 490 (175 70 R13). The result is a huge difference in ride quality, handling, braking, and road grip. The fuel economy is reasonable. I used SGO 10W40 API SM, and the full tank mileage increased by a healthy 50 km. In Karachi city driving, I get 400 km in a complete tank with A/C on at soft foot.

Suzuki Swift has very good interior but has total interior in plastic but we cannot expect any more from suzuki in Pakistan.Suzuki Swift Exterior is not much slim but looks like a flat car. It does not look any type of sporty car. From outside the car looks like it has a 660cc engine.In Interior, It does not have very much leg space and front room looks very bulky because of 1300cc engine.As far as the back room is concerned if the front seats are at medium position then their will be an sufficient space for people sitting in the back.The trunk is not too much spacious but it has reclining seats so if you want to load something you can easily recline the seats.I think that anyone should not buy applied for suzuki swift because of their price. You can get a very better used sedan in that price range. Buying Suzuki Swift for your daily driver is recommended but not on long drive.Thankyou.

Despite of completing 82000 KM in odo, its performance was extra ordinary and it was going on 130km/hr easily on motorway but little struggling to reach 140km/hr speed.The features I am missing in this car is power windows, power steering, ABS breaks and central locking.

The Exterior of the car is tempting and cute. I  owned a 2011 model which was the second facelift and the car didn't disappoint in the looks department.The Interior of the car wasn't the best (material quality wise)  having hard plastic used throughout including the dashboard, door cards , console  and  everywhere possible. Engine wise the car was strong and had factory installed CNG which worked absolutely fine. The car used to run AC even on CNG and surprisingly worked awesome! What wasn't awesome was its fuel economy on Petrol. The engine of Alto VXR is known to have derived from Suzuki Potohar  therefore, has great pickup and torque though returns poor fuel economy. Belonging from a budget  category, the  car merely returned 10-12 km/l  with AC and a little over without. Long travels didn't make a significant difference either. The Ride Quality was great though thanks to Yokohama original low  profile tyres, the car glided and had great road grip.

I am the owner of the Cultus VXR 2019, and here's my review on this carProblems: Okay, now the problem I faced is the poor built quality of this car. When I bought this car in Feb 2019(zero meter) it feels very solid. But as the time passes(about a couple of month) the various parts of the car start making noises. Firstly the hood of the car was not properly fit and it starts making noise, then when I drove my car to about 5,000 km the rear driver's wheel starts making noise and now I have drove my car to about 25,000km and I am facing the exactly same problem, the dealership also don't know how to solve this problem. Also glove box is not properly fit.One of the passenger door also has noise issue. I am not satisfied with the built quality of this car.plus point: Perfomance is quite good. Engine runs smoothly. Faced no issue about its engine oil or other lubricants.

It's very spacious compared to the Cultus and Swift. 4 XL sized men can sit in it comfortably. The automatic gear system performs poorly in hilly conditions, so manual shift is recommended. The engine sound in the lower gears is very irritating, and sounds like a muffled two stroke motorcycle, but this sound disappears when you reach cruising speed. I enjoy driving it in manual mode. Vroom vroom.  But Don't expect it to perform like a normal automatic car. Pickup is good. Steering is smooth as butter. The car has an immobilizer against theft. It has no spare wheel, and has a puncture repair kit and a compressor. I cannot comment on the practibility of this system until I get a puncture.  I wish they could improve the engine sound, because it is a major drawback for this otherwise good car.

1) The size of the vehicle is optimal for anyone who is used to driving sedans like corolla2) The engine is a 1600cc and provides the fantastic fuel economy while retaining all  functions of a SUV3) Vitara is not made in Pakistan its the only European car that is imported in Pakistan and has a full 3s dealership service support4) 6 Air bags.... OH YES.... not even the most expensive local produced cars have that many air bags5)  Low maintenance cost and why is that because its a Suzuki with a 1600cc engine  and is as cheap as maintaining an GLI or 1.6 corolla.Whats bad about it....Well  its a SUZUKI and if  you are a person who are fine with the quality of produce instead of its emblem then its the best buy at the given price range.Parts are expensive because its a European import Resale is going to be slow as the car attracts limited users

Not driven much but giving excellent average of 20plus as winters and AC isn't used.Pros:Excellent fuel average, comfortable seats, build quality and plastics are better considering its Suzuki, braking is good, suspension much better than expected, AGS is nice option with manual.  Cons :Engine noise in cabin in too much, non availability of fog lamps and even no provsion in bumpers to install, price should be in 12 to 1 2.5 range. Final verdict, its a very practical car in given options, with 3 years warranty, dealership and peace of mind that the ride is actually new.

To all those moaning and complaining  about value for money or resale go and buy your local assembled  called  Corolla or Civic. Then some people have more money then brains Ciaz 25 lac,Civic 40 lac and Corolla 40 Lac ,even the Honda city cost more. Ciaz is equipped with ABS brakes ,airbags, projector head lights which the Honda city or the Corolla xli ,gli or base model not have but cost more money to buy. Better mileage then Honda city ,Honda Civic or Corolla,  My car is averaging 15.5 local per litre  and 20 motorway per litre.  Now to those who are crying about resale value do not any car as all cars lose some when you come to sell car. Unless like the last 12 months  rates of used cars have gone up due Pakistan rupee value going down against the dollar as new car prices have increased  some 4 times in the last 12 months.I buy my car for 18.5 lac and l have been offered 22 lac, but l have no intention of selling.

It doesn't have spare tyre but it comes with puncture repair kit and air pump. It has immobilizer key. Talking about the fuel economy, I have driven this car for more than 13000 KM both on long route and in city. It provides 19+ km/ltr in city and 23+ km/ltr on long route (at speed of 90-100) with AC.

I bought my cultus 3 months ago and I am extremely satisfied and I want to change the concept that suzuki doesn't give value for money. And I have driven 8000 plus kms and I travelled on both sides (northern & Punjab side) fuel economy was unmatched with other cars. Comfort & space is brilliant and drive of the car is excellent. Only one issue I have faced is in manual transmission when you are on the first gear the pick of the car is excellent but in ags it doesn't give that much pick in 1st and 2nd but when you move forward it's totally superb. I recently went on the punjab tour my cousin had swift we both had a race on motorway initially swift had a gap because it has higher power after that cultus was ahead swift wasn't able to catch. As I had driven it 8000 plus kms so I can give much better review about it. i want to tell one more things the auto gear shift technology has taken pak suzuki to the other level where you can enjoy both manual & auto transmission.

The interior quality is good, not the best, but definitely better than local cars. The seats  are very comfortable and soft. Cabin noise is as minimal as it can get and AC performance is phenomenal. The original stereo is acceptable, it misses BT however.  The only issues here is the monotonous gray color, a dual tone interior would've completed itself.Fuel Economy:I haven't really driven it on the motorway but in city driving it really averages 15+ easily with AC.Ride Quality & Handling:The ride is smooth, quiet, comfortable and the car never feels under powered  no matter what.

Suzuki Swift is a very powerful car offcourse with a demerit of high fuel consumption. In interior, airbags are the only thing that lags and they should have been incorporatedby now. Navigation system is really good. Electrix sidemirrors and all four electric powerwindows are a great feature but only the driver s side window is autpmatically controlled with a single push and that too just for lowering the window. Coming to the exterior, i think its still the same since 2010 apart from nose grill, allpy wheels and fog lights. The road grip is amazing. The ride is a bit bumpy at sometimes when compared with other vehicles of same category. The only comparison for swift in the current Pakistani market is Toyota vitz. But as per my evaluation swift surpasses vitz in other departments apart from airbags. The main advantage over vitz is availability of spares and availability of the zero meter car.

It is a very decent looking family sedan that costs less to keep if checked via knowledgeable mechanic. With strong body, after ten years of rough use at time of sale it displayed very low corrosion.Though interior is plastic however, the quality is so good that it did not even bore scratch marks despite lack of polish.I would also like to add that apart from being comfortable, the Baleno gives excellent run; 15 kms with light foot in city use while over 17 kms on highway use are the figures that we got from this car. We traveled across Sind (from Karachi to Mirpurkhas more that 30 times) and back in days when M-9 was in pathetic conditions too however, despite that the car only cost us bushings and one damper over ten year use. I miss it, we only sold it because we thought that at 125,000 kms it may expose us to some unforeseen technical expense and we did not know a good mechanic. The Baloch who owns it these days says that the car is perfect for rugged conditions.

Car has good interior and it fulfills basic needs at least. Sound System is good. Back Wiper is missing. Frond seats have lower height as compared to window which makes you sit really uncomfortable. Car from inside is unexpectedly spacious and it really surprises you.Sun Shade is missing mirror Can not say it Value  for Money . Its shape is not beautiful  but you have to accept it .  Sun shades are missing with mirror . This will be Capturing Market soon because  only 660cc locally manufactured car in Pakistan.

AOAi own suzuki Baleno 2003 in white colour. Exterior look of car  is very decent and if kept neat and clean it looks very attractive. Actually it is very much better than its successor Liana. Build quality of car is very much impressive that after 16 years there is no corrosion or other body issues. 1300 cc efi engine of car has nice pick and travelled to hilly areas without any heat up or under power issues. Ac performance is very awesome even in very hot days. Fuel average is also a plus point giving 12.5km/l with ac in city and 14 on long with ac. I kept car with care so its interior is also fantastic. It is made up of plastic but has a very decent  look build quality of is not an issue. Seats are very comfortable. Boot space is very much can have alot luggage as i have removed cng cylinder. Ground clearance is optimum with cng cylinder and very good without it. Suspension of car is rigid. I have installed 15 inch alloy rims with low profile tires.Good resale.

A very good car.Safe and lightweight.Cute and compact. The only downside is that it did not include a spare Tyre and we had to buy one separately and make space in car ourselves to put the Tyre in. This is the reason why i would give it 4/5. Else it won my heart.

While the Alto performs remarkably in cities like Islamabad in Lahore given the smoother and wider roads and relatively lesser traffic jams, it's a different game in Karachi where the traffic situation for a daily commuter takes the main advantage of the Alto i.e. fuel economy away making it a little less worth it specially if a buyer has the used car market in his consideration.

As compared to the options a pakistani citizen gets in local manufactured cars in a decent budget (around 14 lacs) are new alto, cultus wagon r, faw. Hence, the best amoung these are one and only Wagon R in many aspects few are these such as its dual tone interior which make the car looks beautiful, the ground clearance matters alot in pakistan so wagon r provides decent ground clearance the drive is none the less as compared to imported, its smooth, noise less and powerful engine. It doesnot have ABS brakes but believe me they are not less than abs however sometime you may feel if you are braking harsh while driving too fast. Its A/C is the best as compared to all local sedans or hatchback. Resale is good. As well as its equipped with a K-Series engine which is noice less and increase quality of drive...

 Exterior is appealing. Though it’s a small car yet it gives impressive look. Silver one looks elegant and nice.Interior is quite impressive, spacious and beautiful. Odometer is lit (orange). The side slots of the door, dashboard, cup/ glass holders (4), dash board drawer and mobile/ spectacles shelf and for wallet are also available. Comfy seats, extended leg space, power windows and tractable side mirrors, make car a good choice. Luxurious Chilled AC, Infotainment LCD softer, good speakers. The shock absorbers are quite soft. Suspension is smooth. Power Steering and automatic transmission gives you gliding feeler. Fuel economy is very good (15-18 km/l) if you drive it carefully, do nut over push the paddles (both gas and brake). Always fill the gas tank to full . Powerful 660 cc engine gives you dominant feeing. Safety: ABS brakes and 02 Airbags. The seat belts are available for all passengers.Awesome & effortless driving experience which I love.

A car known for its low resale, high maintenance cost and having obnoxious aesthetics. Got it brand new in 2010 and was full optioned, with lcd multimedia, rear view camera, body kit and what not. We also owned 2006 civic EXI Automatic back then and I wasn’t impressed by Liana’s boxy look and not so sporty feel. But looks are subjective. It grows over you with time only if it makes up for it in a good way and after a month of driving that car, began to love it more with each passing day. Throttle response and faster gear changes, low end torque and supple suspension which soaks well the potholes in karachi and kept the car fairly flat through corners. The steering feedback and certain weight to it felt the car was well in control and the engine sound SO AMAZING!

Equipped with android screen with apple and android screen mirroring, bluetooth, wifi and what not. Amazing sterio and top notch very responsive transmission. Fog lamps, airpress and garnishes as well. The only thing bothers me is the electronic power steering, the lack of feedback really sometimes is upsetting. But the comfort, seats and suspension are always there to make you forget it. Just glides through bumps and potholes. Turning radius is also a bit worse than city and corolla but better practicality comparatively. Built quality is so superior as well. Every where you touch just speaks quality. Overall a great sedan and value for money. Isn’t perfect although and i miss sunroof, multimedia steering column and mostly, ALLOY RIMS. But at this stage I’m nitpicking.

I bought Cultus AGS this year FEB and since then I am the only one driving. In Karachi as the major part of the year is summer, I have seen issues with the AGS in hot days in Karachi's traffic. I have observed that in summer when I am stuck in the traffic the warning light starts blinking and gives you the warning. That mostly happen when you have AC on even if its on lowest. The only way to get rid of the warning light is to park your car for 15 mins and let it cool which sometimes is annoying as how come you can park your car when you are in traffic. I asked Suzuki motor about this and the mentioned this is the issue with the AGS. It gets warmed up in the traffic and needs to be cooled. My question is they know they are launching this car in Pakistan, then how come they launch a system which is not reliable for Karachi Roads.Umair Ali

Incredible car I drove all the way on GT road cum Motorway on the 3 day of its purchase from Multan to Peshawar and back to Multan total a little over 1400 Km travelling  in 72 hours with speed around 100-120 km/hr A/c ON while crossing three long buses in a row and not a single time I felt that I’m driving under power or small car. People in Motorway keep asking me about this car as well as watching it’s drive/speed on Motorway making my drive more pleasure-able.

Got my Alto VXR on Tuesday 30th July, exterior gives the impression of being a small car (yes, it's hatchback, we all know what), but when you sit in, its spaciousness appallingly greets you. Its bigger than Wagonr by few millimetres. Suspension is one of the things I liked most. I drove it with 4 adults and 2 children, reached to 120km before university gate reached, neans before 2km distance it reached that mark. With AC on, trip meter shiwed Avg to be at 16.8km/L,but mixed driving style. I should not say it's underpowered as I know I bought 658cc car, so it surpassed my expectations. AC performance is 3.8/5. Much better than the stupid Mehran. While I was driving, drivers of cars coming from opposite side noticed my car and seemed to say 'ACHA, YE HAY WO NEW ALTO, ACHI LAG RAHI HAY'. I enjoyed riding and to add to my joy and pumous looks, I even put My dark Infinix glasses on. Cheers...

The  over all shape of the car is good looking with  factory fitted alloy rims, wide door straps, body matching bumpers, body matching  side mirrors . The interiore  of this car is also good looking the key features of this variant of Cultus are its factory fitted power windows and steering , the dashboard  finish is alright it could be more attractive  like by adding two tone colours to it. The power of this car is good . I am using this car for three years  mostly on C.N.G. the pick on C.N.G.is like on petrol with good average i.e. 15 KM/L in city on C.N.G. with A/C. A/C of this car is also better then Mehran , Alto.

Car looks great when you look at it from front, back and sides until you reach the end and feel the car a little pinched from the rear-top, slightly imbalanced shape there.  There were paint imperfections when I got it from showroom.Front space is great, rear is just okay but car is definitely very comfortable. I travel everyday on GT road from Wah Cantt to Islamabad and I never feel tired. I have the VXR variant, it lacks ABS, airbags, two speakers in rear and an arm rest which should be there in given price. Rest the features are justified to the price.Fuel economy is awesome, mixed long and city it gives me 20-21, motorway it gives me 12-14 at 130-140 KM/h, GT road, 70-90 it gives me 22-24.Ride quality is very comfortable, simply Great Comfort!  Handling is good too, you don't feel like losing the car anytime with good road clearance.Pick is great and for a 1000cc it's not an under-powered car - powerful on all terrains !Recommended car .

While it may have been a modern design back in 2006 I can't help but argue that the exterior looks relatively outdated in 2019.Internally, the Swift is a good performer. The pick of the car is solid specially given the 1300cc engine it carries and it is swift in the true sense of the word. The compact design paired with a powerful engine reminds me of what the VW Beetle gives to the western market. Manuvering through heavy traffic on high speeds and easy parking is what it offers. 'Ghareebo ki beetle' or 'Ghareebo ki Mini Cooper'. That performance although comes at a cost. Averaging between 9.5 and 10.5 kml in city driving it is not the easiest on the average pocket. Interior wise it is just a disappointment, atleast in the long run. An 8 year old car's cabin just rattles at every bump. From the rearview mirror to the dashboard to the doors.

 I must say that it is a complete package, the build quality, performance, features and everything is up to the mark. I would choose this brand new Alto over any imported Japanese 660cc any time. Due to the following reason;1) Brand new, freshly manufactured2) Peace of mind3) Affordable and wide availability of spare parts4) Value for moneyAc performance is satisfactory, for a 660cc engine. Fuel economy is the best thing i like about this car. From its build quality, it will not disappoint you. The car feels very solid and premium. One thing that is a turn off are the side mirrors, a person like me who is prone to use side mirrors, makes it very difficult to use them as we have to adjust them again and again. It moves from its place with a slightest of touch. Even though the brakes are not ABS, they are very responsive and complements to the overall handling of the car. The suspension is very smooth, not stiff at all and feels very solid.

I have drove  it from Islamabad to Sukkur and to Naran. i had very good experience for engine performance  on  every road , good at getting speeds at motorways, GT road and awesome handling capability in hilly areas in bumpy roads, sharp turns and steep inclines. Interior is much modern with android LCD. Front two seats are spacious while back seat is uncomfortable with smaller leg space.  Trunk is not spacious but manageable  if you remove trays. Fuel economy is not good not going more than 14 km per litre.  While  other 1300 cc cars give  upto 16 km per litre.

From front side, it looks good while from the back its a bit expanded which is not that graceful. If you buy the shape with eagle eye headlights it looks more unique with light blue reflection in the headlights and also more graceful tail lights. Overall the body is perfect for those who want their car to be small so its easier to drive but also want spaced interior. Interior is simple, nothing much graceful but its perfect for you if you don`t care about stylish features rather just some space to place your things. Talking about the power, cultus is powered enough if you run it without AC and just looking for a normal throttle not much racing. With AC it feels under powered but you can easily adjust if you keep  it at smaller gear and give more throttle. If you drive it decent, the car gives amazing average. Talking about something people don`t know, if you buy the car in white colour it gets tough to buy front and back doors. Also, they are more expensive.

Well, to speak of its exterior; it's a bit sporty than its previous models and has resemblance with range rover as people say. Build is good, so is the ground clearance. Performance being an utmost important concern, this crossover is in a way better than its competitor Honda Vezel and in some comparisons it lags too. Like the suspension I must quote is way better than that of Vezel but the acceleration wise Vezel takes the lead and that however is because of that car being a hybrid equipped. Fuel economy is as good as a sedan and at times better, even. Depends how hard you're on the pedal. Also the driving modes will impact the collective fuel economy. Sports will give you an ultimate driving performance and pleasure but at the cost of burning more gas than Normal Auto mode. Interior I'd say gives a rugged look, not kind of a modern style. It's a bit of timeless design philosophy that some designs won't get obsolete. Like analogue clock and climate dials

So I've been driving this car for last 5 years, before that it was just under cover parked for months because of no such usage. I was very passionate about fixing my car on my own, have changed body parts like bumpers, headlights, break lights mud guards on my own, as a student this car won't cost much in parts replacements so it often happens that I knowingly hit my bumper after few scratch so that I can again get a brand new look with new bumpers, I know that's insane but I've done that for couple of times. Other than body parts I've been learning about it's radiator, carbonator, thermostat, fuel gauge issues, plug and point functions, installing relays in indicator console. getting new tyres (new ones were imported and a bit broad in size so I also learn the effects in suspension and driving created by tyres), I've also experienced the shocks replacement and suspension boots, how to check shocks, suspensions, and excel outers.I've  learned many visits to mechanics.

I bought a Suzuki Swift back in 2011 because in the market this was the only stock sporty car. In terms of looks. The car can handle just fine. Like most cars do. The cars exterior is build well but minor accidents causes expensive repairs & replacements. The paint faints every day. The interior is not that comfortable. The seat comes with average covers. The dash board is simple.The interior built quality is very low. The car needs maintenance every 2 weeks. The wheel balance does not maintain well. The spare parts are very expensive.  The fuel average is very bad. A small trip inside a city can finish 13 liters easily. The cars ground clearance is average. the body hits every speed bump. As a whole the cars lacks many things and has many drawbacks but its still a good ride and does its job.

Yes it is a 'Suzuki' & yes it costs over 2MPKR. Handling could be a lot better, the car lacks good road grip & often skids on highways on windy days.Now to the good part. Looks of this car are  better than most, probably its best feature. Fuel economy is good even on bad days, you can get an average of 15km/l  (or better) on the automatic variant, like the one I am using. Trunk is very spacious. Ride is fairly comfortable, I've driven it continuously for 600km without much trouble. Pick up is good & tops out at 190km/hr, but you can probably take it further.Overall good car, a few additional features like fog lights & multimedia with rear camera, a sunroof & auto folding side mirrors with turn indication lights can make it worth your hard earned bucks.

The best thing about this car is the fuel average, which is beyond my expectations. My brother has a new 2017 Suzuki Cultus Manual that gives only 11 km/l, which is pathetic for that car. Even an Altis Auto can give you that much mileage.  However, my Mehran VXR car gives an amazing average of 17 km/l, which is fantastic given the expectations of a fuel hike in the near future.I drive 58 km daily and there has not been a single heating issue. The drive is relatively quick and handles smoothly. The car's break response is also excellent that has saved me from at least one major accident. If you are a fuel-conscious person, and think that a car's only purpose is to get you from point A to B, and that spending on a luxury car is a waste of money, then believe me this is the best car you can find in the market.

At last in 2018, Pak-Suz has decided to abandon producing this highest selling car.Exterior: Nothing, just a few lights upgrades. White, silver and gray colours are better. Interior: The same as the first born Mehran. No Radio, no music, nothing. Plastic every where. Seats are just like a knitted sweater. In VXR, AC is just ok. Comfort is highly in negative. Space is just ok for a 5 member family.Fuel Economy:  Euro 2 better, than all the past models. I would say more than 20 kmpl (without AC)Ride Quality and handling: Extremely bad. Starts whobbling after 80 kmph. Though it can reach 130 on motorways, but never try that, its dangerous. Final words:  Fuel Econ is good, AC is ok, Parts cheaps. This car is recom. for  middle class. But still, at the price tags, the given features and comfort were not enough. The same variants in China and India far more better, with a lower price. Pak-Suz should design a better 660-800cc car with a price in reach of middle class.

The car looks beautiful from the outside. It's very compact and sporty just what one needs in today's crazy traffic. The interior is also clean and  modern especially the ODO looks good. I bought this car used from the first owner and was a bit apprehensive about  the quality , after having owned a cultus before. BUT the moment i drove it i fell in love with it. The drive never disappoints be it a straight road or winding turns up the mountains, i enjoyed every bit of it. The suspension is a bit noisy at times on bumpy roads but that can be easily shadowed by the overall drive quality. The drive is really smooth and comfortable and cabin is very quiet. The AC is also good. Even with 5,6 people on board, it doesn't loose acceleration. A great car built by Suzuki and the best in its class. Haven't driven the manual variant that much but the auto variant  with ladder type gear box is a treat to drive. Would recommend this to anyone looking for an AT car !!

Yea! The car is  20 years old but still looks better than most ridiculous boxy Japanese cars. Good ground clearance better than all hondas and Japanese  cars. Better for urban and rural use.Interior is where it lacks all the excitement; Cheap, 3rd class plastic . But it has excellent space in the front and back. I am 6 foot 3 inch but can still  ride in the back seats.Suspension is designed unlike hondas and toyotas as honda prefer stiff suspension which provide good handling but lacks comfort while toyota prefer soft suspension which provides good comfortable ride but lacks handling pleasure. But suzuki provides a mix of both you will get normal comfort and normal handling.Fuel average in city is 11-12 km/l while on long it manages 15-16 km/l.As the engine is smaller and body is bigger so it does overheat on long routes but its not underpowered like pathetic 660 CC JDM's.

Suzuki is renowned for its desirable motorcycles, but its cars historically haven't enjoyed nearly the same respect. The Suzuki Kizashi midsize sedan is a serious attempt to bring the company's automotive division up to snuff. Billed as a sophisticated sports sedan at a family-sedan price, the Kizashi generally delivers. It looks sharp, it drives well and its interior is one of the nicest in the segment. While the Kizashi is billed as midsize, its dimensions actually fall in between that segment and increasingly large compacts. This means it's in the unique position to compete against both camps. It's larger, more luxurious and better built than most compacts, yet less expensive and agiler than the midsizers. We think it's definitely worth a look, but the biggest obstacle could be finding one given Suzuki's limited dealer network.

For its tiny dimensions, the Carry boasted a pretty large load area with a load deck measuring 1,620mm long, 1,340mm wide and 1,100mm height. The vehicle had also received a few design elements which make it look pretty cute such as the huge headlights, a wrap-round bumper, the sculpted bonnet and the huge windshield.

Good Exterior , Good  Fuel Economy, Smooth Ride, Best for small and  average family. Some friends are comparing the car with corolla and  Honda etc. which is not fair because no doubt that Honda and corolla are better than mehran as far as the safety, durability, speed and reliability is concerned. Due to these better features these are more expensive as compare to mehran. These cars are three times mores costly. Similarly their fuel consumption is also more. If  some one possesses 25 lakhs for  corolla then he can buy almost 3 mehran  and the combined life of  these 3 mehrans becomes more than corolla.

Its seats are very comfortable with strapped in feel what I believe  it's superior then Honda accord of its era.... Because one of my friends own Honda Accord 2011 local one....

In a nutshell, exterior is flawless. Having company fitted alloy rims , exceptional paint quality on bumpers ( as I had  old cultus and alto before , there bumper paint quality on bumpers and edges was little bit compromised)  and Much better grip. Interior is same as exterior. It is the blend of  quality and craftsmanship. Most of the people compare  Cultus with city and swift, Sorry to say that all are in state of serious insanity. If you compare price tag for on road 0 meter cultus swift and city, VXL costs you 14.5 million, city  currently 17.8 million and swift for  15.5 million ( for non-filer) . And  rest of  the people , claiming that  cultus is marketed globally with price tag of 9  million, then let me confirm, it is the basic variant and the top of line variant cost  13 lakhs just factory price and if you import that 0 meter car after custom , freight and insurance etc it would cost you around 23 lakhs , which people are talking about. Hope you will understand.

Previously I was using Vitz as small car and Civic as long route family car. New combination would be Hustler and Vezel due to the better ground clearance and fuel economy.

Driving the New Cultus Auto Gear Shift from last two months now.

Fun to drive, especially the AGS Transmission which allows to drive with either Automatic gear shifting or enjoy realtime Manual Gear Shifting. Suspension is also not that stiff comparing it with other hatchbacks.Fuel Average : 15 ~ 16 KM/L within City. (Fuel: RON 95)In my opinion better than 1000cc JDM  hatchbacks.

its sporty design is getting old but still  eyechatching. and better than most of the hatchbacks. its a hatchback having a sports engine so ofcourse the milage is above average. but if your looking to get a minijet,  Go for it. It really is a minijet. 02 sec 0-50km/h. most people complain about the fuel average. I'd say only buy if you have a big heart to spend money on  fuel. Comsumes more fuel but gives you an experience of  a sports car. its not made for long drive only made for urban areas with high speed. overall the car is worth it. makes you feel  you own the road.

This car is surely good value for money, in pakistan people complain about quality because they have been spoiled by Japanese domestic market cars . i am glad i did not buy an accidental used japanese car and settled for cultus alhamdulillah.

I think the edge of Swift over other hatchbacks is it's 1.3L engine. It's engine is powerful with excellent pickup. I have automatic variant but I found pickup is faster than most 1.3L manual cars. Since beginning I am using Shell V power and getting fuel economy of 11-12 KM/l with A/C in urban area. - Air Condition is also good. - Car handling and grip is excellent. - Interior is average.- Interior accessories quality is average- Exterior is good- Exterior accessories are good and robust- Engine parts seems to be mostly imported(of Nippon Denso ND) so are seems good.Recommended for those people which need powerful hatchback. I also advice to regularly maintain car from Suzuki Authorized showroom I go to Suzuki South(Karachi), after every maintenance cycle you will feel good improvement and seamless experience.

I bought this card in June 2017 and i have been driving it for last few months and found it very comfortable. Comparing it with other Japanese card it is a much batter option if we talk about after sale service and parts.Fuel average is good and getting batter day by day. Words of mouth suggest that it will reach to 18 KM/H with in city. Car interior is very attractive specially of VXL variant. Driving pleasure is there and from inside it gives touch of a luxury car and overall i am satisfied with my selection because in this price range this is the best option.

It featured two different 16-valve gasoline straight-4 engines, with 1.5 L and 1.8 L, this one capable of 125 PS (92 kW; 123 hp) JIS.

The price does seem steep at first but once you sit and drive  in it you realize this ca is in a class of its own. cars like Vitz etc are almost in the same price bracket as this  (if not more), are used models,  and have no real value. The interior is beautiful. Yes there  are places where cheap plastic is used but thats the same case with any other car in this price bracket.

The fact is I drove about 600Km, it is giving 17.6Km/L average with AC in city drive. I didnot took it on long drive uptill now so cannot say anything about long drive fuel consumption.Its room is spacious, its seats are comfortable, drive is very smooth, gear liver is very soft, steering is very cool, very minor sound of engine come in cabin when you drive, brakes are very impressive, AC cooling is really very good, when you turn on AC you feel no load on engine. From past seven years I drove many variants of Toyota Vitz/Passo, Dihatsu & Mira. The thing is they are all used cars & most of them are accidented.

Few weeks ago we were getting news that this year Suzuki will launch a new design model of Cultus, but  personally  i have to say ""Maza nehi aya yar"" . Old design was  perfect it just need little bit improvements like interior may kuch change dety, Dashbord texture, handbrake k agay ya cd player k nechay cup holders hoty, steering Suzuki Swift  jesa hota , kuch technical features introduce karwatay  1.3 engine 4 door  version may introduce karwatey , If we talk about exterior , it's my opinion not the fact. k  old design thora ziyda aggressive lagta tha  mean that design was more aerodynamic  compared to this latest one, door handles Suzuki Swift jesay hotay door opening handle. suspension, transmission  and comfort level thora better kar detay or baki sub theek tha.

I think The  reasonable price of  Cultus VXR should be Rs.1175000  & that of Cultus VXL 1250000. ...........Now I am thinking about Faw V-2  or OLD Cultus/some Japese Imported cars but I will never buy this new cultus in this price and  I will neither suggest any friend to buy...If Suzuki want to continue his performance in the market, they should update his mindset about Pakistanis that now we are  aware about  everything that you are doing with us from  last few decades.

Extremely stupid pricing policy by Pak suzuki. 1000cc hatchback with  price of 1.4m+ you gotta be joking. Who moron will by this shit this expensive. Even suzuki's own swift is better at this range and why not go for Honda City instead this expensive piece of carp. Is there no regulating authority in Pakistan to keep watcher on these vultures. People should boycott this. Price wiase and Feature by Feature FAW V2 is far better than this car.Its time for people to wake uo and say no to Sszuki's monopoly. They haven't learned lesson even by watching Ciaz getting flopped due to same reason.

It looks better in pictures. Same pathetic tires that you have to change after buying the car. Outside styling is kind of odd & it does look cheap. Suzuki guys told me that I should compare this car to Vitz (2014 and up) as they introduced it to compete in that category. So you be the judge of that.Interior is good and spacious but the sound system (keeping in mind the price) is not good & all around cheap plasticy feel is there. And it is not comparable to its japenese imported competation (vitz).Well dont know about the fuel economy exactly but the average that it had in its meter was 10 KM/L (last driven)My Final words about this car are it's price should be around 10 (1 Million) comparing to local standards. It is just a Wagon R with some extra nut and bolts and new face. If you can afford 14 Lakh you should go for some other VehicleIt is not the answer to imported vehicles.Suzuki is competing their own brands like what about suzuki swift?

A local Manufactured Suzuki cultus is now no more in the range of a white collar person.  A huge price of 1415000+registration with a booking period of 4 months is not digestive at all. Strange thing is that cults has become more expensive than Suzuki Swift, by this I can predict that in near future a new model of Swift will be launched with a price tag of +1.6 million. Once Suzuki was known as a brand of white collar people but now I will suggest that if you are willing to get a new car then better to look for used Honda city or used Toyota instead of this dubba type car.

The car looks good but overall size is no more than WagonR although height is bit less. The car more looks like an upgrade to Alto or Mehran rather than Cultus. Cultus used to be the medium sized hatchback but this version is very compact in comparison with that.Again Suzuki has maintained its brand reputation by using cheap quality plastics in its interior. Seems PakSuzuki lives on another planet because their competitor Honda is offering 1300cc Sedan with double horse power for only 1 lakh additional. Moreover, Suzuki itself is offering a 1300cc (Suzuki Swift) good size hatchback for less than this crap new Cultus.Fuel economy will be good as it is using same WagonR engine. Handling is a bit improved than WagonR but not as good as previous Cultus.Car was already jumping and doors were creaking on bumps. PLEASE DON'T BUY!!

Its very much OK to youngsters but lack sophisticated looks for elder people. Interior is very good and classic looking. two tone color scheme is beautiful. Inner space is also very good. Transmission is superb, easily coast at120 kmph at 2.5K rpm. No body rattling so far.

I don't understand why there is so much negativity about this car here in the reviews. I bought this car this year solely on the basis of reviews in Pakwheels forums.The car looks good from the front but overall its a bit of a turn off. However, the interior is really spacious and comfy. Pros: The dashboard and overall plastic quality is satisfactory for a car from Pak Suzuki. The drive is also smooth. The suspension is solid and not very noisy on bumpy roads. The steering is also very good, a little slippery but a nice steering cover can fix that. The sound system, immobilizer and nice spacious interior makes it a really good choice in cars of this  category. I would totally recommend this car to anyone looking for a car under 11 lacs, which is still high but worth it as you're getting a zero meter car. My version comes with electronic throttle and the pick of the car is very good and responsive. Cons: very thin stock tyres and slight road grip issues at curves on high speeds.

The AC becomes better from November till February, when you really need a heater. There is no insulation of the car and it becomes an oven very soon. The stock rear view mirror and side mirrors are no good and you need to put in mirrors from other car models in order to see properly. There is no intervalometer in the wiper, and you have to manually engage the wiper every now and then. The fuel economy of this car is way over-rated. Whatever you gain in mileage is off-set by expenses on repair maintenance of wheels bearings, suspension and steering assembly.

Exterior: Exterior looks sporty and good design in small size.Interior: good looking with easy access controls.Fuel Economy: People complain that fuel economy of swift if not good. I have driven my swift 2500KM so far and it is giving me 15 on Long Route with AC and 13 in city with AC. What I observed it all depends upon footwork: P I usually change gear around 3000 RPM. No doubt it can easily cross 90KM in 2nd gear easily ?Ride Quality and Handling. Handling is very smooth and good. No vibration at all at even 150 Kmph.Good vehicle in given price range. Even I suggest this over JDM because of BRAND NEW car.

Exterior looks a little bit classic from front and ugly from the back. Suspension in the back (leaf spring) are way to much stiff. They reduce the handling but increases its relaibility. Front suspension are satisfactory.AC is just the same as before the introduction of efi. Ac is not that good, might satisfy front passengers but not the one in the back seats. Ac sometimes work good at night but in day time, its perfomance decreases with time. Steering is a little bit light when one or two persons are in the car but above that the steering becomes hard. Although it has 39hp engine and Daihatsu Mira 2007 has 55hp but still i managed to beat it in a race with 3 people in Mehran. It has responsive engine but it isnt smooth and jerks when foot is lifted from the pedal. Dosent feel like a new car when you newly buy it and most of the time you regret it. Spares are easily available and its simple and easy to work. The car is v.much overpriced and should be avoided as it fails to satisfy

The two specifications GL and GLX come with transmission choices of five-speed manual or four-speed automatic.Powered by a three-cylinder 1.0-litre petrol engine developing peak power of 50 kW at a high 6000 rpm and maximum torque of 90 Nm at 3400 revs, the Alto doesn’t set the world on fire off the mark – 17 seconds to 100 km/h with the automatic transmission – but is good enough for tootling around town.A drag coefficient of just 0.30 and low rolling resistance tyres see the manual Alto’s combined fuel consumption down to 4.7 litres per 100km, with carbon dioxide emissions also falling in its latest model down by three per cent to 110 grams per kilometre compared to the original one. The automatic Alto has petrol consumption of 5.3 litres per 100km, but that’s still very economical.

I was apprehensive of buying Suzuki due to its reputation and many people suggested second hand imported JDMs. Finally i played a gamble and went for Suzuki Swift Automatic. The first drive took me by surprise as i felt in total control of the vehicle. The stearing was light. The power was reasonable for an automatic. Excellent road grip. Nice interior. Suspension felt a bit stiff . The transmission is smooth. Then came the ugly part. I noticed periodic noise and some times grinding noise when i pressed hard on brakes. Took it to the dealer next day. They had to adjusted the brakes to eliminate the noise. This should not have happened to a new car. But anyway they provided excellent support and fixed the issue. I can also hear small rattles in left door panel. Other than that i am happy with the car's performance. Suzuki did a real good and surprising job. I was not expecting this level of satisfaction with swift. My advise to all the folks. Forget about old JDMs. Go for Swift.

Wagon R is a good car with a noticeably better pick than all the rest of Suzuki's budget offerings combined. The steering is also buttery smooth thanks to its electronic nature and the brakes seem responsive, even though they are not ABS.The exterior is okay. The front looks beautiful with the deer-eyed headlights. Fog lamps can be added to provide further beauty. However, the rear looks like a pathetic 'dabba' and it isn't streamlined at all. Fuel economy was good at 16-17 km/l in city traffic. The average dropped to 14-15 km/l with AC.One of the worst things I experienced with Wagon R is its instability at high speeds.; cross the 100 kph mark and the cabin begins to vibrate. Exceed 120 kph and the vibrations become unbearable to an extent that you have to slow down. I believe the cabin shake is a combination of faulty rims and the 'tall-boy' design.Wagon R's gearbox is a bit of a pain in the reverse gear but I think it will get better with time.

I was in search of a car that i would keep for atleast 5-6 years .its interior and specially the colours which make the cabin a very pleasant place to sit in ,legroom space was very good for passengers and driver also.The exterior is a combination of Apv and Swift which looks very absurd like most of the japanese cars on road these days, because this is the only tall car offered in this segment so it takes time to get used to it but driving it was the part that really pushed me to buy this car.i liked the acceleration and the smooth ride with very quiet cabin and after reading reviews on wagonR owners club about its fuel consumption i decided to go for it.So far my car has clocked  5700 kilometers and Alhumdullillah i am happy that i have made a smart choice.The acceleration of this car is excellent ,the ac is just like new corolla and city,Suspension is very good on rough roads and ground clearance is perfect. i will recommend all to buy as this is a very practical car

Who says Swift has poor milage? I drive my Swift with extra care. With tyre pressure F/B 33/30. Speed 50-80 and drive between Isb-Rwp. Gear shifting between 2-2.5k (sometimes till 3k) RPM. No hard-breaks, car slows down on gear instead the max it could. The new Swift gives me 16-17 KM/Litre. I am happy with my buy Alhamdulillah.On the other hand, rear leg space is very less. Even less than my ex-Suzuki car, Cultus. Suspension is super hard and body assembling is not upto the mark as its JDM versions have.Lastly, PKDM Swifts have 1328cc M13A DOHC 16V MPFI engine is a non-VVT. I must say that Pak Suzuki never fails to disappoint its customers.

I love my Dinkey. I am owner of Mehran Euro II VX 2012. The car is a sort of legend in itself, I bought it brand new and have yet to visit a mechanic in three years although I have really been abusing the car by being very rash to it. The car gives me a mileage of around 16 KM/ Liter in Lahore city: A city with choking traffic and then, it touches 100 really fast on petrol, can pull upto 130 on highways and can squeeze through thin traffic lanes. Also, I hit the car a few times and it cost me nothing: for one accident, I had to pull out Rs. 600 and for another just Rs. 800. its is simply a student/ young employee's best friend. It's so cheap to maintain and I, with a daily travel of 40KM, can go with Rs. 2,000 in case of CNG and around 3,500 in case of Petrol. It is awesome and then add to that very super resale and can be repaired fom a place right across your dhaba.

 I bought Suzuki Liana 2012 model from Makkah Motors Karachi back in May 2015 as certified used car for PKR 950,000/- whereas Honda City and Toyota Corolla market price for 2012 model was above 13 lacs. So far it gives 10/11 km per lit in city and 14/15 km on highway. I have no idea of CNG as I have a petrol driven only version. Plus points:1- Comfortable Drive even more than City/Corolla2-Low-profile vehicle which suits for those who are likely to receive extortion slip (bhattay ki parchi) on keeping a high profile car. You can keep it if you reside in any disturbed area3-Chances of theft or snatching are really very low4-Insurance is less costly. Insurance company do require compulsory tracker like Toyota5-Parts are cheaper than city and also easily available6-Very smooth drive within and outside city7- It has electronic brakes and power windows unlike XLI8-SUZUKI 3S dealers are across the country Points to Ponder:1- Low resale value & high tax

Exterior is beautiful. When compared with Honda city  or toyota vitz. Although some people will prefer vitz, i think this car's curves are more pleasing to the eye, than the angular lines of the new vitz.Interior is simple but not bad. The controls are light and easy to access from the left hand while driving. The interior is almost all plastic, which is  normal for cars in this price bracket.The engine is sufficiently powerful, with DOHC, 1328 cc and 90 bhp, it can easily break free from the highway traffic, or speed off a stop light. Higher RPMs are easily managed by the M13A engine.  The engine lacks VVT so fuel consumption is not a highlight, but the power output is basically linear and predictable. I sometimes felt the engine fell short on torque wih 110 Nm. In my opinion a torque output of 150 Nm would make it more pleasing to drive, especially when loaded and climbing. 5 MT is very smooth and shifts pleasurably, had no issues with it.

I bought this  car on 18th April 2015 since then i have done 9k on it. I have taken this car to its limits i have drove it on dusty terrains, smooth roads, rainy roads, the car has performed extraordinary i never expected a car from Suzuki like this. I was thinking car like mehran or cultus which could get loosened up after 5k but it has performed good.. its throttle response, mileage (19-20km/l on long routes w/A.c, 17-18 within city w/A.C), grip, suspension has made to believe that Suzuki can make up good cars. i have speed it up to 160km/h (on favorable condition please do not replicate this speed because speed kills)i would also add up that there are pros and cons to every thing so here is the con of Wagon R: the stock tires are not that much wide which creates an impression that it may roll over on steep turns ( I have tried it on steep turns it does not rolled). i have kept it in stock condition and soon will be going for my wagon's 10k checkup.

Well, i think I am the first one who tested it at top speed of 180 , have posted the pics in wagon R group . The car was stable but 180 is too much , I wont advise any one to take that risk . :-) . Due to height of car i was so careful while driving it on wind areas , but it was cool . No need to worry at all , change your tyres to 175 70 13 as already mentioned in my review and enjoy the ride . The fuel economy is still going good getting 15 in city , 21 out of city with 3 RPM with AC . Wish if suzuki could upgrade it with an LCD , ABS and power rear windows,.

I bought this car last year, 2014 and I never regretted it. It has all the accessories like power steering, power windows, power mirrors, ABS, alloy Rims, Bridgestone Tyres, etc. Moreover, as it has a powerful engine of 1328 cc (when compared to the size of the car) the pick of the vehicle is tremendous. So in this price this is the best vehicle. Cars like Corolla XLI/GLI or Honda city do not have these features and their engines of 1299 cc are comparatively less powerful. This vehicle has followed the concept of quality rather than quantity. I would suggest people not to buy Vitz which at the end of the day is second hand screwed up, used vehicle.

I bought this car 6 months back and really loving it. Stylish and sporty look with graceful interior. It is the best deal one can get in this price. When you buy this car, you don't have to even think of adding any extra features, it is already fully loaded including ABS, power steering, fog lights, media player, nice seat covers, power mirrors, immobilizer,  key less entry etc.1328cc engine that too in a small car means lot of power. In acceleration, it can easily beat corolla and city. You feel like having an extremely responsive car in your hand. Fuel economy is reasonable. 12-13 km/L in city and around 15 on highway. About the defects people complain: One odd issue may arise and it is common with every car. But, it is still much better than buying a Japanese VItz which has come to Pakistan after being screwed for 2-3 years atleast. Actually running would be more than 70,000 Kms but people will buy it with a meter reversed at 9,000 kms..

After three months, there was noise and vibration coming from the back side.

Ave-Fuel consumption (without AC) is 17.28 km/L on smaller roads in Karachi.  Should be even better on longer routes.After over 6000 km, it is excellent for daily runs. I love the ride height and would take this car over any other for peak rush hour movement. Good for smaller roads too where parking is a problem.Ride height is excellent, visibility is great.

Its acceleration / pick is good as it has got a relatively big engine compared to cars of its size, but the chronic issues with Suzuki remains the same. The seat are not that comfortable, Braking system is not reliable. The fuel consumption is on a higher side compared to Honda city or xli in cities & on long routes. Interior is not bad. exterior shape is sleek and stylish but it depends upon the individual to like it or not.No words about maintenance as I never came across one. Final words: If you are spending like 1.4 million and u can manage a few more hundred thousands, go for honda or toyota. But as a second car its not that bad an option.

I bought this car last year in August. I must say this car delivered me with the amazing package of enhanced fuel economy plus comfort. As I m not much concerned with the looks of the car rather i prefer better fuel economy with due comfort..It easily gives one with around 17 kmpl within city (i have not driven this on long routes), means with even light foot one can achieve more, quite cabin (no external noises when driving on busy routes) Apart from the better fuel economy this car gives clearer vision via rear & front wind screens due to its height. It is a very good addition in the  PS product offering and unlike crap cultus which is being developed with low quality materials.Wagon r offers good space for driver even a tall height-ed guy can easily fit in, passengers also enjoys this spacious vehicle along with the driver. It is perfect value for money.

The best car in it's type. It will be its fourth year with me. Fuel Eco is excellent as I kept it on one brand of engine oil.Interior as comfortable as that of a city or Gli.The engine performance is excellent and pick up is at its best even on AC.A must recommended car for BACHELORS and small families.

When I first bought this car, it gave me few problems:- Brakes were a little loose- Clutch was too tight- Fuel consumption was too high- trunkThen a year later car had an accident and front was totaled. It took a lakh to fix the car, which was cheap, and car looked exactly like it was new. It was after the accident that I noticed that the fuel consumption was much much better. I think the work on the CVT transmission may have made the fuel consumption better, and  provided a much speed and control of the car.Even before the accident the car was giving a soundless drive with good suspension. I would recommend this car to bachelors, and those who want a 1 up of Cultus, otherwise spend a little more and get a xli if you can afford it.

I really admire this vehicle. It is probably one of the best productions of Suzuki uptil now.Yes it does lack in a few things but if you can keep this car with care, its probably the best.I have owned this car for a whole year and only once had to replace its brakes but uptil now it is running completely on stock installations.The engine is quite powerful and quite noisy as well. But it gives excellent mileage. Probably the most fuel economic 1000cc car in Pakistan. Easily gives 17-18kms per litre within city with AC. Long route it gives 20kms/l.The interior is admittedly of cheap material. after some wear and tear of the vehicle, it starts squeaking from places where it is hard to find. a well maintained and cared for Cultus is excellent for driving in Pakistan :)

aoa, when i seen the adds and seen pictures and specs and Indian sites as same is also being started there i was impressed. I thought Suzuki will aim high and provide a car with latest trends however when i reached the show room i was disappointed as many features & accessories which are advertised as style-mark are removed even from VXL version and put on sale for around 95000 if purchased all in one go.It speaks that Suzuki is aimed at making money and doesn't care about customers. secondly there is no one regulating prices and standards every authority is fed well to close the eye.

Hi! I purchased Wagon R Stingray (Japanese) back in December 2013. This car was just awesome. Having airbags, anti-lock breaking system, fully loaded, power steering, power windows, retractable mirrors. The car has a beautiful basket inside the frond passenger seat. Beautiful mirror with light inside the sun light protector ( don't know the correct name this is what is in front of driver and front passenger to block sunlight)When Suzuki launched its model in Pakistan I was very excited and the very next day I visited Suzuki Showroom. I was just shocked to see what they are selling for Pakistanis. Do they think we are useless people? Our life costs nothing? In Pakistan assembled Wagon R there in NO Air Bag, Anti-Lock Breaking, Only front windows are powered, No retractable mirrors even the seats are uncomfortable.Still the price is almost 1 Lac high.I don't know why people are still purchasing this bull Shit. Suzuki has no right to play with the people of Pakistan

The most asked question about Wagon R is its mileage and for me as our 4th car this was the only concern for us and after careful calculation as a un-biased user it gives 14.9-15.1km/l in Islamabad ALL time with AC at maximum. on highway I havent tested yet but will be around 17-18km/l max.Now comfort, the VXL interior is very good except for these two issues that are, back windows are manual and Side mirrors are not automatic I dont care much for that because if you set mirrors once and you have AC on its not a problem. The driving posture is unique in a good way after driving Civic when I set I feel like driving an SUV and its a good feeling but seats are flat I feel like without proper seat belts I would fall off of them.In short after we drive Civic, Corolla and Daewoo all nice saloons with nice road grip and interior when we drive this we dont feel bad or anything like you do when you drive Alto or Cultus and Mehran instead this gives you a nice feel.

Built quality: Suzuki has surprised me with the good quality. Drive is nice and quiet. Pick up is good...but it is not a race car...so one should not expect to hit high ""G's"" when accelerating.Overall loving the car. I think it is a good addition to the Suzuki lineup. Yes the price is high...but then what are the options?? specially if you do not want to risk imported no-service no-guarantee options.Cannot comment on fuel economy too much at this time as it is too early.

Comfort is excellent, Silent cabin , rear seat passengers were even feeling comfortable while comparing it with cultus , etc. Road grip was good with Dunlop 175/70/13 tires and have enjoyed its engine's quick pickup in 2nd and 3rd gear . AC was chilled , brakes are good but ABS could have been a better option for such car . Over all, very good experience, however within city I am getting 12 Avg with AC .

People who jump from Mehran, Alto or Cultus, love this car. But this is not as good as it is being appreciated.No doubt, exterior shape is awsome, but inside, rear seats are space less actually. Suzuki actually placed LIANA's engine in it, 1328 cc. That falls in the category of 1300 to 1500 cc, so registration of a car without trunk, is as much more than Corrolla XLI or Honda City.So do u think a car made by Suzuki having engine 1328 cc will consume less fuel than 1300 cc cars?Bad idea....

It has awesome interior, plastic quality is way better than cultus, city, it has soft steering, soundless engine and cabin. I have changed its tire to Dunlop SP Sport Lm703 (175/70/r13), after this ride is more comfortable and very stable, it still give me 14.5 km/l within city traffic mostly jam packed with 70% ac and car still to have it first 1000 km service, so it will surely improve.Its stand out features are AC(awesome performance), Audio player, interior capacity and seating position, noise less cabin, smooth acceleration, power steering, goods brakes.Some negatives are 1) Take a little load on AC as compared when ac is off (I think engine is new, it will be better after first service).2) You feel wind pressure on cabin if its heavy like near sea and sometime we have very windy weather in karachi. 3) It would be great if it has ABS, power side mirrors and auto back door window.

Got Wagon R , Blue Eyed Tall Boy a week ago. Its VXL Version . Lets discuss what is + : (comparing Cultus as there is no other comparison) Interior is good , speedometer is stylish , driving seat is owesome, commanding view , spacious , gear shifting is so smooth . -ves : Tyres are so small, I have to get them upgraded to 175 * 70*13 . The company fitted is 145*65*13 completely bull shit . Rear door windows are manual, I mean what the hell Suzuki is trying to show us . Over all, car is very comfortable, very silent cabin , AC is chilled , road grip now is excellent with new tyres. Have driven up to 120 on canal road . It was quite smooth . Better option to get rid of Cultus . Much better option indeed .

Well, Exterior is not that much good as was is expected. However, if we talk about interior, it is really cool. But still the material which has been used is of low quality. AC works awesome, Seating is really comfortable. I had a drive for continuously 7 hours and felt no cramps in my legs or tiredness.I got 17.9 Kms/Ltr. with AC on Highway Drive. Within the City, it gave 13 Kms/Ltr.I'd a long drive with WagonR, I was worried due to its small-sized tyres, but it is really amazing, I went upto 150 speed and it went awesome. Brakes worked so good, pick is so nice.I was worried after reading the feedback, while I bought this car. After having personal long drive. I am so much comfortable with its performance. I was a user of Cultus and must say that if someone is looking for good exterior looks than must go for Cultus but if you want really a new change within the same pricing, than WagonR is 100 times a good change Suzuki have made.

I was reviewing the comments of every one. Its very simple . Do we have any car in 110000 PKR (Brand New , Not JDM) , coming with Power Steering , Power Windows , Rear Seat Belts, K Series Engine (Fuel Economy = 18 KP / Long Drive with AC) , beautiful interior ???? No, the only choice we have is Cultus with noisy dashboard , total manual ,14 years old model , and handling is not better that Wagon R , you dont feel comfortable while driving it on 110/120 on highways . Do you?? if any one does , he is making fool out of him.  When , we dont have any choice, why not go for one of the world's highest selling car ??? By the way , I am not from suzuki as mentioned by some one that all reviews are coming from Suzuki , you can visit my linkdin profile in case of doubt. Have fun, get the Blue Eyed Tall BOY (WAGON R) booked.

This  car also failed at the very begginginand i suggest that go for a japanese car instead.Worst choice i want to sell this car and there no one ready to buy it more than 6 lacks.

I went to Pak Suzuki to checkout the new WagonR. To my disappointment the car's first looks were very ugly. Why would I even have a test drive or check it's comfort or fuel economy when it looks worse than Adam Revo. They have stripped off some necessary car beauty elements such as good front grill, air pressers, alloy rims, under-engine protective shields and the list goes on. They went too far with the practicality and now it looks more like a donkey cart than a car worth 11 Lakh. Gone are the days when people didn't have other options and they had to buy Mehran, Cultus or Alto. Now they are aware of the features, the cars have these days (Thanks to JDM cars). Wouldn't someone prefer a much better Passo, Vitz, Mira or any other JDM car over a local Wagon R for this much price? I wouldn't buy this car for more than 8 Lakhs.For JDM WagonR, view the link given below.http://www.pakwheels.com/used-cars/suzuki-wagon-r-2009-for-sale-in-sargodha-726958

Dear Friends,Most of the reviews seems like coming from Wagon R guys i mean Pak. Suzuki, I checked the car a couple of weeks back and test drive it as well, I was disappointed to saw the interior and exterior from style to strength,No safety parameters are taken in considerationThe drive though was not that good, pick is fine, cant comment regarding fuel economyI will recommend the VXL version, if someone deciding to go for WagonR, but bringing a VXL on the road costs more then 1.2 M, as the person has to pay (on top of 1089000) for freight, registration and 145/80/R13 tyres must need to be replaced with a wider and good quality tyres.Best Regards,

Suzuki, though is a market leader in Pakistan but has never impressed me due to the poor quality control . After the launch of Wagon R  the company has really changed my opinion, a car which looks small from out side but  is very specious once you enters the cabin.Its height gives you an edge of  commanding view and control once you are on driving seat, The suspension is awesome with an excellent engine pickup,the added features like power window and key less entry  further adds to its comfort.  the car is also economical  on fuel.  over all much  better then cults and can be easily compared with Swift in its class.The AC  also powerful. Draw backs........??? they should have also given power windows for rear doors, and should have ABS brakes, The car is going to capture the market soon.over all a good addition to the deprived market of the country.

If I compare this car with other 1300cc cars it has better performance than those it can easily take over gli xli city and even an altis or a civic cannot catch it till 140. But its not only about performance it does not have that much comfortable seats like corolla gli or city and even vitz the interior is also not that much attractive its just simple and I found vitz interior better than swifts but swift has much more space than vitz or cultus. We cannot compare cultus with swift cultus is too far behind. The interior quality is fine. If we look at exterior it is good. At last I will say that is car cannot be used for a family if you want to buy a 1300cc car best option is city or corolla. But if you want as a personal car just go for swift. If you are a guy aged 20-35 you will love this car because mostly guys only see performance of a car not interior or comfort. Oh yes fuel economy is also better than city or gli.

Hi Friends,If you are thinking to buy a car and your budget is 6-7 lac rupees I would suggest you to go for Mehran for the following reasons:Exterior: Good exterior and wide range of colors availableInterior: It has got a decent interior with all the basic itemsFuel Economy: Excellent 16-17+ in city and 20+ on long drive. I know few friends will disagree with me on this but let me clear you one thing..YOUR DRIVING STYLE DERIVES THE FUEL ECONOMY..If you drive it like a GOOD DRIVER it will give you good efficiency BUT if you are a newly converted driver from RICKSHAW driving to car driving you will get only 13-14! That's not the car fault, its YOUR fault.Ride Quality: ExcellentHandling: ExcellentFinal Words: If your budget is 6-7 lac you should only buy this car. Very easy to maintain.

After driving and owning almost all the versions of hatchback suzuki cars being in use in Pakistan, I was inclined to buy the city IVtec this time. Got the opportunity to drive this car on it's launching which was a pleasant surprise. The car looks small but  very spacious  from inside while sitting at the driving seat you feel to be in a commanding position because of it's height. The A.C and brakes are effective . The acceleration is also reasonably good. The 2 tone dashboard looks beautiful. We should not compare it with the imported cars for abs brakes and air bags as they don't have the company backup or release value.

Although its not a bad looking car. You can't get a car with all these features in such a low price tag. Excellent package. But my suggestion to go for VXL which costs just 40k more and you don't need to spend much on accessories. It will be peace of mind.

Over Swift 1.3 is a beautiful design and performs a lot better than so called other big names like Xli. We were apprehensive to buy automatic version but now after a month of use and over 1000 KM milage we are glad that we bought the automatic version.The exterior is very elegant and has sporty look. We have the white color which I think looks pretty (personal view on color). The interior is fine although not luxurious. The car comes with immobiliser and has factory fitted Bridgestone tyres and Alloy Rims save you at least 40 to 50K when you buy City or Xli. The Alpine stereo system is nice and is adequate for daily use. The performance of Swift is excellent, great pickup, and stability even a high speeds. The breaks are super responsive and have ABS which Xli lacks. I'm getting 14kmpl easily with RPMs around 2000 to 2200. If you drive it steady and not like u are driving on a race track, you can get great performance. ONE HAPPY DRIVER HERE!

The car is small, loaded with 1300cc engine, with this can easily get little marginal roadgrip, though interior at times give you a pure reflection of Suzuki and local made vehicles.When first i saw this car, i loved it and wanted to have it, so finally i purchased 2013 model (a big mistake), and i never recommend it a good family car. The biggest problem is space, Seats, Trunk and secondly, fuel consumption in domestic drive is worst though better in long routes. Lastly trunk, spaceless.Later i used Vitz, which i recommend over this.

Why does this car even exist? Obviously because it's considered economical. But is it actually economical when it costs 700,000? You can buy an old Nissan for 400,000 and spend the rest of 300,000 on petrol which is enough to take 3 rounds around our planet earth. So Yes, Mehran provides the best economy but in a world where no other cars exist.

ITS A SERIVICE CAR NOT A LUXURY!I have read many reviews, opinions about this BECHARI MEHRAN.hey guys what are you looking for in a Mehran Luxury? Style? Comfort? Innovation?Aw come on please, looking for these stuffs in a car with price tag 0.7million? I feel pity on such people.now come to some points, Im sure all of you guys will agree to some extend.its a Andey double roti, sabzi car. I think you got my point, guys its a service car not a luxury saloon which we would buy in 0.7 million.its cheap on fuel.cheap on parts.cheap on services.cheap on repairs.best resale of all times.its not for a pleasure drive or long distances. but still we can use it for long distance drive as it has best fuel economy.now for those who are really looking for the luxury then, above all forget the resale and fuel economy, cheap parts, cheap repairs, just go for the Japanese car 660cc, you would find everything in it, but still those cars wont beat the Mehran.

Exterior of the car is eye candy. Sporty, compact and smooth. Headlights, fog lights and rear lights all compliment the sporty appearance very much. Interior wise nothing out of the ordinary but it sure gives a solid and secure feeling to the driver and passengers. With a bit of chrome here and there it does give you a good feeling to be sitting in Swift. Sound system is awesome! Fuel economy is poor, as a result this car loses its charm.It has good handling and can reach high speeds in a fraction of time, ABS compliments it as well.Final word: If fuel economy is not a point of consideration for you then its worth it to enjoy the fun of a Swift. Otherwise, I won't recommend investing nearly 13 lacs in such a car ;)

Suzuki Swift is Better on value than corolla, i bought this car in October, new it was, and still is 450 Km on ODO and guess what it gives a "" 14.65 kmpl "" in 2-3k rpm. ac is excellent, just in 5 minutes i satrt shivering with a 36 deg on temp i found it hard to keep my hands on steering which was directly in line with ac ventthis cars features are better than corolla well ofcourse drive is not that better than corolla, but the actual value one get from it is!. final cost of it was 14 lac, i also considered corolla but i'm more into actual value of product rather than some resale value of a crappy ""KHATTOLA""the plastic quality is the same as that of a corolla, comes with ABS EBD, central locking power windows alpine sound system alloyrims color door handles etc, hence everything what a near cost corolla lacks, remember that when i bought it this car cost me 14 lac where as a equivalent corolla would have cost me 19 lac. which is just being insane for a useless boot.

Swift is a very spacious Car from the inside. The seat are very stiff and not at all soft and comfortable. Dash board is nice to look at but material used is cheap. Good number of features for the price (Keyless Entry, ABS, Power Windows and Side View Mirrors)ted.Ride Quality & Handling is EXCELLENT! 0-60 kph acceleration is wonderful. Brakes feel a little hollow and not very powerful and the steering is very stiff despite being powered. Road grip is very nice as well as cornering. Compared to Corolla runs better but the brakes aernt impressive and the steering is very hard. Shifting gears is also not very smooth and the gear stick tends to get stuck oftentimes.

People who come on Swift after driving cars like Cultus, Mehran, Alto always say that swift is a perfect car.My cousin came on Swift after Mehran and he always admire the Swift by saying that swift is as comfortable as Accord and as powerful as Gli.But how can a Mehran user say such words? Because Mehran does not satisfy definition of car.I came on Swift after City (on advise of my Mehran user cousin) and I was shocked because Swift is far low quality car as compared to City.Only exterior metal quality and engine can be compared with City But Seats, Interior plastic and suspensions are far lower in quality than City.My Swift's interior started to give tick tick noise only after 12000km. Tick Tick noise come from every door and in amplifies on bumpy roads.Seats are not comfortable as compared to City or Gli.Interior plastic is very very low quality if compared with City.

Being a car fanatic, I always hated Suzuki Mehran from my childhood. And my favorite activity (like many of Pakwheelers) was to insult Mehran in every other post :) But when I entered professional life, I realized I can't spend my weekends in workshops just to get my vehicle running during weekdays. That was the time I needed some new vehicle.My maximum budget was 900 K and the only brand new car under this budget was Suzuki Mehran. Other options were to add some money and buy Cultus or go for imports (Mira, Alto or Passo). My considerations were running costs, ease of maintenance and resale.Analyzing these factor the optimum choice came out to be Suzuki Mehran. I currently own both the VX and VXR versions. Fully satisfied with the VX one but the VXR is horrible on fuel average even with AC off.Fuel Economy:VX giving 16-17 kmplVXR giving 13-14 kmpl without AC 10-11 kmpl with AC

Exterior: Average exterior, same shape since 1989. Head lights are excellent. Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Space is good, knees do not stuck while sitting in the back. AC performance is much better than previous versions. However, at 100 kph, and temperature above 35 degree, AC performance declines. Easily runs at 140 kph on motorway without any shake ups. Since there is no CNG, trunk has a lot of space which is an added point. Fuel Economy: At 75-80 kph on long route without AC, gives you 26-28 km per litre, excellent, with AC gives 20-22 kpl. In city with or without AC, it gives 16-18 kpl, I found no difference with AC. However, at 130-140 kph with AC, it only gives 12 kpl.Ride Quality & Handling: Drive is smooth and handling is also as per expectations from a mehran. No difference from previous versions.Final Words: In Rs. 658,000 it is a good car for middle class family and it is the cheapest local assembled car in Pakistan. VXR better than VX.

Spacious, good quality plastics used and comfortable seats. Very beautiful silver built-in music system's dashboard.Fuel Economy: This is probably the ONLY con of this car. Fuel-wise it's not as efficient as a city or vitz. However, this also depends on the driving style.Ride Quality & Handling: Amazing road grip. Superb acceleration. Really feels like the seat slipping from under you. No car can catch up to it. Not sure about the new Aspire 1.5 - but all the 1.3 cars were never up to the challenge of speed posed by this little beast.Final Words: This is one of the best cars to be rolled out of the PS assembly factory yet. The build quality is as good as a Civic (if not better). I can say that because I also own a Civic 2013.I have driven this Swift very rashly as well, taking it to far fledged areas of Punjab - but it's smoothness in the drive was never compromised. My advice to people who are considering to buy a 1300CC car - go for a Swift - an excellent ride for urban to sub-urban dwellers. Even though I am myself a Honda fan, I would recommend this Swift over a City (unless you want to go an extra mile and get the Aspire 1.5 which is a total waste of money because a few more bucks will get you an Altis - a far better car than Aspire). City's suspension is the worst ever - Swift is a very good car and can fit in many different roles - a first car for a young professional, a first car for a young couple or a small family, a second car for a upper-middle class family, etc

I bought Swift DLX manual back in July 2011. Within the first month of its use, I experienced a tuk sound in low speeds and quick pick up. It was very annoying for me so i reported the same to My dealer (Suzuki Taxila Motors) from where I initially bought the car. I was told that it's the axle's fault. They reported the matter to the company. An authorized person (Mr. Ibrar)of Pak Suzuki for this region checked my car and said that its because of a pin in the gear box and that needs to be changed. so they lowered the gear box and changed that pin. the sound went off but only for a week. it came back and is there ever since.... Finally I was told try to live with it 'coz even the Japanese can't do anything about that......It really frustrates me!!! So did anyone experience the same sound?? and found any cure for that??? plz respond!Apart from that the car is Ok as far as its style and comfort is concerned. Fuel consumption is not that gud. Would give around 11 kmpl in local with AC and 14-15 KMPL on the highway. without AC the local average goes to around 12-13 kmpl and on highways from 15-16 kmpl.

Exterior: Its exterior is just superb. The looks of swift is damn hot from every angle. Motto of swift lived up to my expectations. ""Feel Young Drive Young"".The only bad thing about it is low quality doors. They must have used good quality doors.Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Its interior is also quite attractive with very nice 2din CD Player with 4 awesome speakers which have very good bass and sound quality.The things which i wanted more are media buttons on steering, it would be too good to have. And less sound in cabin, but it is SUZUKI so we must know about it when we make our mind to bought it. Front seats are little hard but its ok, Rear seats are very soft and it is quite comfortable at back to sit.Fuel Economy: Fuel economy is good, its definitely not what people said. Within city with little bit ac it is giving me average between 11-15km/ltr, depending about driving style. But recommend people to change gear in btw 2-3K rpm. Ride Quality & Handling: Swift has little hard suspension so the ride drives kind of sporty with excellent pickup and very good at cornering. But is quite rough on bad or bumpy roads due to hard suspension but it is not the cars fault, it thats the road are quite bad here.Final Words: If anyone wants a brand new hatchback in the range of 1.3M then i will definitely recommend Suzuki Swift. Its the best bang for buck.

840,2013 Suzuki Swift DLX Automatic 1.3,4," Feb 24, 2013","

Exterior: The overall look is greatInterior (Features, Space & Comfort): Has excellent set of features, lots of buttons, everything automatic. Pak Suzuki however (compared to the international version) has removed ABS, indicator lamps from the side mirrors, Outside Temperature reading and Estimated Mileage reading from the Pakistani version of Swift.Fuel Economy: 12 KMPLRide Quality & Handling: Ride quality is horrible on bumpy/damaged roads. Pak Suzuki is not fully doing there job when it comes to finishing. They probably don't even do a drive test before the car is made ready for delivery. You can spot a thousand problems in their brand new car, mostly mechanical issues. The inside of the doors are bare metal without any padding of  sound absorbing materials etc. So they vibrate when you crank the volume up on your sound system. Also on bumps the ride gets too noisy. On smooth roads however the cabin is pretty quiet. Suspension is hard, but that gives you the advantage of good braking and good handling.Final Words: It is for sure a lovable car. You can really feel the thrust with which the car moves when you push the accelerator all the way down. One reviewer mentioned that the car doesn't move above 120KMPH but this is because he couldn't really push the accelerator further down. I'm not sure whether this is a feature or not but accelerator pushes very easily until a point. Beyond that point you need to press it quite harder and that is the point when the car actually goes above 120KMPH. Build quality sucks big time, but the engine doesn't. I'm really enjoying my ride.

I brought the car 3 years back. Its the fully loaded version at that time, power steering, power windows and alloy rims. So far after three years every electrical and mechanical equipment is working fine. This car has the best leg room space in its class no doubt. I have also driven the Honda city, the rare and front leg room of Cultus is amazingly equal to HOnda City and the ride is even much more comfortable than Honda City. Its unfortunate the Suzuki has stopped the VXL version of cultus (only to promote the Swift) but I wish that they re-launch its fully loaded version with Electrical Power Steering (EPS). My VXLi has hydraulic Power Steering. Overall its one of the most comfortable, reliable and fule economical car in town given me almost 22 kmpl on highway and 17 kmpl in city with AC on CNG. On petrol it gives almost 17 kmpl on highway and 15 kmpl in city with AC. I am very much satisfied with this car and am using it for the past three years without any problem. I got it zero meter and so far it has crossed 66000 kms.

I have sold my vitz 2010 model and switch to Suzuki Swift 2012. Initially when I got the car it was horrible in fuel consumption. Build quality is fine but not like VITZ.Problem: The body paint is of very bad quality and badly done, so silver and white color are preferable, in a zero meter car it is full of noises coming from interior and dashboard. Rear sears are not comfortable, low visibility and difficult to park in tight places.Plus Points: After 5000km 2nd inspection the car is superb , great fuel consumption on petrol and GAS, 15km - 16km on petrol in city without A/C, and 220km on Gas with 55L cylinder without A/c,Pick on gas is awesome even thought my car is automatic but there is no pickup issue. All sounds that are coming form interior are removed by Suzuki people at 1st and 2nd inspection for free.Had a great day with my Suzuki Swift at Suzuki Workshop for Second Inspection 5000kmJobs done.1-Tighten of all nuts, 2-Shocks and Suspension inspection,3-Oil Change,4-Coolant Change,5-Transmission Oil Change,6-Engine Tuning,7-Tappet Adjustment,8-Brake Servicing,9-Silencer Inspection,10-Wheel Alignment and Balancing,11-Power Steering inspection,12-Throttle Body Clean,13-Oil filer change,14-Car computer inspection,and more ....

suzuki has released a very nice machine for first time, that is swift. it has got style, engine is powerful, cabin is comfortable and quiet and a good AC, overall its a nice package. but compared to popular belief i want to clarify my brothers here that suzuki swift DX is not that awsome as it seems, against popular belief, it does not have keyless entry (after spending 12lac you dont even have this basic option), no ABS breaks, door knobs and side mirrors are black no matter what color your car is (imagine 12lac bucks spent and this!). no fog lights!!!, well alloy rims are not present but thats acceptable. as a whole running acceleration pick is equal in DX and DLX, but in gadgets DX is just shat.i suggest with this money either go for DLX (13lac after registeration, one thinks why not buy city :p) or buy imported vitz, with loads of options. thanks

AOA,I have bought a VXR mehran. Many people beside me bought the Japanese models. they suffer for parts... you can't find the market for parts of those cars as compared to Suzuki cars. People say that there is no problem with the parts etc... Becasue new cars do not need parts... they will need maintainence after 3 years and than they will come to know... Only Vitz has been the best cars in imported ones. you'll not get the resale value of imported cars after 3 years. You can suffer alot to find a similar side mirror. or head light or brake light/bumpers etc. If you can bear costly maintainace you can go for Imported cars.beside it Mehran is the best choice to drive inside city. Very cheap maintainance. Very good Feul economy sepcially after new EFI engine. engine is better now. and the best thing ever you can sale it in one day. and you'll get good value.

This car is a hit across the globe…you can watch reviews with world renowned brands on review forums such as Top Gear too.I drive in dense traffic routes (Mauripur, Shershah etc)…and with A/C it gives me 11.5 to 12.5 km/ltr…you just need to watch your driving habits…a powerful engine will always consume more fuel if pushed hard.

Please consider this review in response to end up this confusions regarding whether to by SWIFT or NOT?I personally own this vehicle. The car is excellent on fuel, this gives 10-12KM in local and 15-17KM on long but it totally depends on how you accelerate the car and gear shifts the corresponds to RPM. This car is ultimate choice of the market and hot cash as well. Very power full engine and huge accelerating … I have done full meter (180 KM/H) in its 4th gear and the 5th gear is just to maintain economy.

Now world roads are seeing my new vehicles that are hybrid and are of new generation design as well. But we Pakistanis are still playing with the old ones like Mehran and Bolan/Hi-Roof which is not giving value for our money. Being a 600K++ vehicle its too much for all of us and I think if we can bring a competitor then we will be able to shut their plant down for these two vehicles. Better for SUZUKI to look towards APV production and other models as well as people of Pakistan needs this kind of vehicles in great numbers.

Car looks nice with change in front grill and lights2	Interior feels batter with change in inner roof fabric3.	Seats are more comfortable4.	Quality control lacks as new car has trunk locking problem5.	At least car should come with foot mats 6.	 Price is very high as compare to luxury which is avail in imported cars of same range

since i am a new user to car and i just purchase mehran vx euro 2.i am not aware about the performance of other cars so unable to compare but i can share my experience and statistics about EFI mehran. fuel average is 20 km per litter on long rout. i have ran it 1400 km and in city it is about 14km per litter. engine dont heat up as i heard about this problem from many people who used old mehran. still i did not installed AC so can not comment on it. i felt its brakes are not good they should be more improved. i will share the statistics when i will used and installed the ac in it. till now i am enjoying it. sound of engine is less now and smooth as well. pick is good as it is on petrol. i drive it on 120 speed on long rout but on that its road grip is very poor so its good to drive on 85 and 90.

Suzuki Alto (now discontinued) is a well reputed car in Pakistan even with its outdated engine and looks.This car comes with the same engine that was used in Potohars back in 1980's with minor tweaks for CNG and fuel consumption. Over the passage of time Suzuki has hardly made any interior/exterior change. Car prices are constantly rising and its price started around 5 Lacs is not at 8,21,000 Rs which is not worth the product and you may opt for Imported Car in this range and even lower.The handling is a nightmare on its Stock tyres, and the car is also extremely stiff and bumpy. So changing to softer and wider tyres is recommended, which will make a lot of difference in its comfort and grip. The car will handle fine till 80kms; above that and you will feel like losing it. It comes with hydraulic steering system which is acceptable for the reason that EPS at high speeds due to high steering sensitivity will become a risk.Interior wise this car has sub standard build quality and squeaks from a new car are nothing new. Recently they changed the traditional cassette player to JVC CD/mp3 Player. The seats are a little uncomfortable specially while turning when the body roll takes over and you literally start moving to the sides. The A/C works just fine if not good.Exterior wise the looks still come from the 90's and nothing has been upgraded; it even does not have rear screen defrostThe positive point is its spare parts. They are as cheap as anything and you can get them from almost everywhere at some serious cheap price. So driving in traffic takes the edge off you.Economy on CNG is around 4Rs/Litre while on Petrol with A/C; local it would hardly give you 12km, on Long route it increases to 14km/l which is still not acceptable for 1000cc Carby engine.This cars engine has been discontinued worldwide and recently this model was taken off the chart from Suzuki Pakistan.

Hello everyone.I am living in norway and i had to buy car for my parents living in lahore. I had a tough situation to get through. Here in norway swift is a hit. I decided to go against advice of lots of people(which obviously was to buy toyota or honda) i decided to experiment and bough suzuki swift. I drove it and just kept on driving i fell in love with this spectacular machine as response and overall quality was awesome. No other car in pakistan comes with so much pre loaded gadgets. Keyless entry,Power mirrors,power steering,power windows,power cooling (AC is super cool)smooth gear shifting,bridge stone tyres,good sound system(no need for aftermarket expense on replacing sound system as it give you decent and enough bass to enjoy your journey) and last but not least ABS features makes it one hell of mean machine. Accelaration is the best part of this machine. Love its engine sound as it sounds compact and crispy whenever u press accelarator. Dint spend alot of money after purchasing just paid for poshish and mats and nothing else. Although little tight in diggy but one is not always on a road trip. Well compiled package by pak suzuki this time in a good price. Hats off to suzuki guys for giving us suzuki swift and breaking traditionaly duopoly of honda and toyota.

People here want used cars in cheap price with brand new looks named as (original and genuine) lolxx and simultaneously the seller want to sell his 6 yrs old mehran at the price that he didn't even pay 6yrs ago...... In economy where we are short of gas and excess of inflation rate..  and people drive with not even basic knowledge of driving rules. Mehran suppose to be the best (so called) car anyone could have :p

same old car, suspension should have been improved, should have installed new engine at-least twin cam engine, only carburettor has been replaced with efi system, there is no way that this car can give better mileage that Japanese 660cc cars.the only edge mehran had was company fitted CNG which is not available.grill is changed, i was very hopeful before the launch, i will suggest Japanese 660cc cars like(mira/kei/alto)

Pak Suzuki has produced an horriblE junk which is nowadays called mehran. I have a 2009 mehran and an 1986 fx. Fx is much much better than this. It can go on 130 easily on petrol with ac and it doesn't get over heat. At least fx is much stronger and it has a defogger as well. My sister was driving mehran, it's gear got stuck but when she tried whole gear stick came out. Mehran is a horrible junk and its ac is fantastic for nothing. It hardly can go on 110 on petrol. Instead of this by cuore.

style is good,superior to all small cars available in paksitan i.e vitz and cultus etc.comfort...my personal experience is that this car is very comfortable for all but not for driver.no doubt that very large space and a lot off adjustables are available for driver but i tired too much when i drove it 970 kms in two days.two persons were available for this long drive but still we tired too much and it was not a good experince.we covered this same long route on coure also.and coure is a small car but we were quite fresh with long drive of coure. performance is very good,ac is very good,on petrol max speed 165 km with zero vibration.engine temp gauge always remains on same position in all conditions i.e as weather, speed, load, road condition etc..even after 12000 km i have no need to add water for engine cooling.its still factory filled fluid in the tank with same level as at time of delivery.value of money.....what i can say about that i bought brand new and with documents it cost me in 11 lacs..and now after 6 months the available show room price is 11.5 and if i think that if i try to sale it and i can recover my whole amount.fuel economy.....after my a lots off calculations and observations, i found that it cost me 7.5 rupees per km(if petrol 106/litre)...dont forget that in this price u enjoy  a chilled a.c, power steering, power break,and power windows. over all......on petrol if u can afford,its is the best in small cars.my personal experience.....if u are fully loaded ( 5 passengers) it can hit even with those speed breakers also from where u have crossed smoothly   before.....back mirror range area is very small as compare to other cars,this can tease u if u depends  frequently on back mirror.....there is a small antena on the roof made up with soft rubber alike material.it tease u when u cover the car with a normal canvas cover.if u dont have a suitable hole in cover then with the weight of cover, antena tends to bent slowly in banana shape which does not look beautiful.

Mandi Bahauddin: Suzuki dealers in Punjab  are looting customers under the cover of  registration and freight charges of vehicles. A customer who booked Suzuki Mehran said that Suzuki Dealers Jhelum  received Rs 21000 as registration charges and Rs 15000 as freight charges on delivery of vehicle. He said he requested the dealers to give him vehicle documents and he would get the vehicle registered with Mandi Bahauddin Excise Department but  the dealer refused to oblige him telling that it was Suzuki Company policy that dealers would get the vehicle registered.  He also refused to register vehicle with Mandy district and registered vehicle at Jhelum, a station of his own choice. Excise authorities when contacted told that registration for Suzuki Mehran was near about Rs 15000. Regarding freight charges no bill giving details was shown to him. The customer further told that attitude of dealers after booking a vehicle grows harsh and they dictate their own terms. About quality of Suzuki he said its several parts were not fitted properly. Rear and front bumpers were tilting downward. Leaf springs of rear suspension were not in proper alignment. Interior holstry, vinyl and lining of doors were not properly fixed. Wheels balancing and vehicle alignment were not satisfactory. AC which costs Rs 52000 gives poor cooling and runs heavy. On first inspection, faults observed were pointed out to mechanics who said that these faults were caused by poor and bad workmanship at the factory while assembling the vehicle. It may be mentioned that Suzuki Mehran is a vehicle that people with low income purchase. Under Yellow Cab Scheme this vehicle is sold on easy installments to selected persons at price one lakh cheaper as compared to those who purchase through booking. This disparity in price is unjustified.Sher Gondal

A month back i had an option to Buy a car for myself. It could have been anything Gli, City, Vitz, Belta. Basicly anything with a small engine. :D . So after much thought i went for the Suzuki Swift. I had never driven it before, and sat in it once when it was newly launched. When i picked it from the showroom i was expecting it to be a typical Suzuki. BUT was in for a surprise. The 1.3 Dohc is one mean machine. The power Delivery is BIG, it simply goes crazy . I agree its not like Gli in terms of fuel consumption but it covers that with the fun factor when u floor the pedal. :D . The ABS does what it is supposed to do, the breaks are responsive. The ride compared to the City is MUCH better, City is known for its hard seats. But the Swift is comfortable on long drives and on bumpy roads.         When one thinks about SUZUKI the word BAD QUALITY instantly comes to ones head. But in the Swift its diffrent . The build quality is impressive. Suzuki has left no loose ends, both from the inside and out. The Air Conditioning is as they say CHILLLING :D  The leg rooom happens to be excellent for a person of good build and height i.e 6Foot and 80kgs .        People may say that 12 Lakhs is TOO much for a Suzuki or rather a small car. But the thing is its not a small car, its a hatchback!!!! What car gives u Alloy Rims, Keyless Entry, Fog Lamps, Power Windows and Adjustable SideView Mirrors in 12 lakhs and that to Zero Meter. The tires supplied by suzuki are good Bridgestones, not the EURO STAR that come with Honda and Toyota. A good stereo Supplied by Alpine which complements the whole dashboard and completes its look. Impressive, no.?        You the reader might say im going on showering praises on the car cause i own it myself. No thats not the case , im telling from experience as i have owned or happend to drive its competitors and yes the Swift has its flaws. Its heavy on fuel. But it does give 11km/l and above with normal city driving. And i happend to notice it does have UnderSteer, maybe its the way i drive but it does tend to messup a bit in the corners. Another FLAW i noticed is that the car is low, when at full capacity driver has to be carefull on the speed breakers. The resale value on the other hand is considerd to be LOW when taking into account other cars.      Thats about everything i have to say about the car. In looks its small , Drives like a big car and goes like one aswel . I personaly do not promote rash driving but in times of need or emergncy the swift is perfectly capable of doing 170km/h on the Moterway . Tried and tested to 175km/h. I hope my article helps you in deciding on the car if your intrested :))

My new swift Dlx was delivered yesterday. I had many concerns as I have been suzuki products for more than 15 years, But when I looked at exterior, interior & specially drive its not near suzuki. Its unbelieving  more than I expected from suzuki! The package price is bit more than cultus for which I had initially opted, but its sporty look, road grip as good as city, ABS, alloys imported tires,fogs,power pack, quality audio system & most of all its looks hatchback & smallish but its driving ease, grip & performance all matching any perfect new sedan.Well I can not predict about fuel economy as I have not driven it much. The other negative is lack of proper trunk , but its still useful for little bit luggage. The other comparision is Vitz, but its definitely used one with expensive parts. I will say this car is the best issue of Suzuki Pakistan so far, I can suggest if trunk is not considered of supreme priority, swift DLX is much better choice than XLI/GLI/city         Now it has been driven about 3300km, the fuel economy is average. 3s says it will improve after 5000km. It is giving me about 11 -12 in city & it consumed 1.25 tanks from Abbottabad to Lahore(about1000km) & back with A/C , on Motorway & speed of 120km/h with occasional 140 for overtaking, so its fine.It has great power & it easily touched 170plus on motorway.

Just because its Suzuki and parts are available does not make it a good car at all owned a  2007 cultus fully loaded and that car was a joke! interior was just rubbish & plastic, power windows suck you have to get them repaired every now and then, once you start using CNG your petrol mileage will go down regardless of your car fitted with a  factory cng kit, has no road grip at all was doing 160 on super highway and had to go off the road to stop the dam car feels like the brakes are made out of wood, and the worst part is the transmission cultus transmissions are the worst of the lot, all in all I would never ever recommend buying a cultus  at all sold mine just after one year, my suggestion if you really have a hard on for a cultus go for the original Jap or the american chev version of the cultus they were good but the Suzuki Pakistan's Cultus sucks! i guess its about time that we consumer start using our rights and stop buying cars from these local corporate giants to bring them back to their scenes so they can come up with real cars for the real road in the 21st century!

Suzuki Cultus is a fine car for those who dont have driven larger cars than cultus or if its their first car. People who have driven larger cars than cultus find it rubbish. The interior is not of good quality. The engine makes very much sounds. The car applies too much force on the engine when going uphill and cultus has larger body as compared to alto and they both have the same engine of 1000cc. So i think that altois cheaper and better than cultus. Instead of buying a new cultus worth 925,000 you can buy 2004-5 model corolla or honda city. So please dont buy the cultus i also had a cultus like this and my father sold it in just one month of its purchase.

A luxury car if back seats are not that spacious...!!! no need of a trunk to rate as one is not on a road trip every time to have his clothes & food filled up..!!Rest is not important if car is not fuel efficient & comfort level is not high..!! Any one challenging my thoughts..??

Nice car with a really amazing fuel economy. I have checked the KMPL a number of times, it was about 22 KMPL on long route in over drive (5th gear) and was about 13 KMPL (within city). However, my rpm gauge does not cross 3000 revs in any gear and i keep my oil and especially air and fuel filters clean and change them regularly.Overall a really nice car. Why buy a bigger car without luxuries than buy a smaller car with a good deal of luxuries.P.S. The car has a hidden feature. Rub the antenna on the top of the car and it grows a ""dikki"" ;)

Suzuki swift DX is an excellent car, specially if you are looking for Suzuki high end model at low cost. the car is perfectly comparable to toyota corolla and honda city in terms of comfort. it has beautiful shape, good fuel millage and plenty of seating space.Swift has power steering in both models contrary to the Pakwheels.com features description.

Mine arrived six months back and I must say I am disappointed. Yes disappointed at manufacturers like Toyota, Honda and the likes. The Swift turns out to be a direct and ruthlessly angry stare in the eyes of the other 1.3 liter counterparts.Positives of swift are certainly a lot more than the Negatives. For Instance the Alloy wheels, Imported Tires, Power/window-mirror-steering, and the worthiest mention ABS add great value to the overall package that one pays for. A relatively decent sound system with only one downside (The speakers buzz at high bass levels, obviously on high volumes). The car overall pays-off fairly well given the amount spent.Before i forget to assert on the ridiculous mileage, let me just add that the kind of power swift delivers would certainly bear a price tag that comes in the form of high fuel consumption. But then again the power delivered through the 1.3 liter mechanical piece of art justifies that to a great extent. I have managed to attain a 10km/l mark within the city, which is decent. Fill the tank and a one-side sprint on motorway can be done in a little more than half a tank equating it to around 18km/l.I have had a chance to manage a pocketful of road tickets on motorway for speeding, but my toe just wouldn’t ease without flooring the gas pedal. Crank it, kill it and knock the 175 km/h barrier fairly easily. And by the way I love doing that. I heardGreat work Suzuki. Simply love it.

Got mine in the 1st week of January. Since it was the first Suzuki in the family, I was a little skeptical on how things would turn out. The first 500kms have been alhamdulillah satisfying. The fuel average that I got (that's after the 1st refilling of the tank) is 12.98 km/l. I've seen people saying it doesn't give more than 9-10 initially but 12.98 is what I got. This includes extra urban (traffic jams) as well as straight roads mostly with no a/c since it’s winter. The new integrated in-dash is a nice touch. The volume knob is so easy to operate just like the one in the Vti-Oriel. Since mine is to be used as a second car (self use only with primary commuting to office and home), I was initially planning for the DX version but the additional 100 grand it worth the dough. Keyless entry is a must and so is ABS and Alloys ad a little glamour to the overall silhouette of the body.If budget is not a problem, the DLX is the one to go for. Nonetheless, Suzuki should be commended to provide basic amenities like PW and Central locking in the base version. Not to mention imported tyres too.Things I don’t likeThere is no assist grip for the driver and there are no jacket hangers at the rear assist grips. The steering despite being electrically assisted feels a like heavier than my steermatic’s. And it isn’t as precise either. Legroom at the rear is virtually non-existent and people with families should look at other options too.Overall a nice package and good value for money.

I have purchased zero meter Liana Lxi in 2006. First of all i found value for my money when i got this car on the day when i made payment. Mean to say i have not paid premium of Rs. 100000 to Rs 1500000 which was common for toyota ready delivery in those days. In my six years ownership i have found this car very good. When we use cars then some repair become due with passage of time but with proper oil change and routine maintenance condition of each vehicle can be maintained. In Pak market competitors have created image that Liana is not good car but i personally feel that this is done only to promote their vehicle and enjoy the premiums they charges for the maket vehicle image of their cars.

I read several reviews, some people like,  some doesn't like it all. After reading some reviews I am confused.  I have asked my relative to buye me Cultus with CNG. Since I will be visiting Pak in few weeks. I am sure In few days arrangements  will be made for buying new Cultus with factory fitted CNG.I live in USA and will be using this car few weeks a year on my visit to Pak. I know in 2009 Suzuki offered power stearing, alloy wheels, fog lights and power windows previously.To my disappointment these accessories are not being offered now. I want a car with dual fuel factory fitted CNG, not after market install.As far as I know, right now Toyota and Suzuki  are they only ones. Offers petrol and CNG in few models. Choices is very limited in Pak for dual fuel. I like Toyota crolla with factory fitted CNG, but driving few weeks in a year doesn't justify to spend close 18 grands. So I decided to go far Cultus 2011.Though it's 2012 but still in Pak market 2012 Cultus is not available yet. I don't understand why is that. Here in USA 2012 models were available in Sept. every year.I visited Pak Suzuki web site and was very disappoined. Very minimal informations were available about their freking products. Under specification  O is written. I thought it mean ""optional"" . It should have been S ""Standard"".Any way I would like to ask this forum. When new models of cars comes in market. Such as 2012.

I bought  Alto 2003 second hand just four months before. I had mehran first. Its the worst car i ever had because its driving is like you are driving a truck. Coming back to alto, its an amazing car in a cheap price range. Its driving is so smooth like a luxurious car. The interior is perfect, sides are covered with plastic material. Brakes work fine below speed of 80. Engine is powerful. Car can be easily turned in a small space. A/C is great. It gives good mileage on CNG as compared to Petrol. I think this car has no comparision with coure or mehran. You can say Coure is an improved version of Mehran.Howevere there are some negative things as well. The engine of alto is a bit noisy. Road grip in not soo good with the tyres fitted by suzuki. The car starts a little bit shaking above speed of 85.Apart from that, Alto  would be an extra superb car if suzuki has installed power steering, power windows and ABS in it.Overall its a perfect car.

Of all the choices we have under a million bucks, cultus is the best choice.

Spacy interior compared to its size.2. Good colour choices.3. Fuel Economy. Mine does 150km on a full CNG tank.4. Good road grip and control inbuilt in its design frame.Low points:1. Over priced.2. Poor quality of built. Noises and Sounds in new ones as well as poor quality of material used such as in doors.3. Poorest acceleration in its class.4. Cheap interior.5.

I've been driving/travelling in an APV for almost 4 years now. (in fact i learned driving using this vehicle! ) Firstly lets get to the basics, the Price. Currently its a bit overpriced. Though i would still go for it as a family 7-seater over any jeep/vehicle in this price range. Comfort: To be honest for an imported vehicle its not the most comfortable car. Though i have seen worse, much better than many Pakistani cars/vans. (and it has LOTS of SPACE! ) that's all that matters, i guess.. Consumption: On CNG its fairly cheap. Specially on long drives. On petrol its a bit expensive cause of the extra power due to the weight. But i'd prefer driving it on petrol all the time as its totally at a different comfort level on petrol! (though i don't pay for either, so i guess my opinion doesn't matter. My dad pays and he says its good on CNG :P ) Now to the other things that matter, Power: it has lots of power! the 1.5L engine is just about the right size for this vehicle. Safety: Here is where the APV looses most of its points. It has NO ABS! That really is the worst part. NO AIRBAGS! The tires, play an important role in keeping the car stable. if you change them to bigger ones, you might increase the comfort but decrease the stability! its fairly stable, as a teenager like me hasn't killed himself yet, using the vehicle. So its stable till that extent. Though after a few years it will be very risky to drive it over 120 km/h on the Motorway or anywhere for that matter, as it wobbles, and feels very unsafe. Practicality: It is the best car in this section. It has LOTS of space for ANY type of luggage.. Though the CNG cylinder does take a bit of space in the back, there is still room to put two big bags behind the rear seats. You can easily fit 10 people in it. Though the people at the back will be a bit squeezed. Add one of those roofs to it and your luggage problem for these ten people is solved. (if each person has a bag ) Overall, it is one of the best Cars/Vans i've seen in Pakistan. And in this price range any other vehicle of it's type can not compete with it. Though if you can manage the cost of fuel, i'd suggest getting a Prado or Pajero.. As they are more fun to drive and has way more power plus comfort. Only problem would be they'd be old and the APV would be brand new.

Sir, in that case and according PAMA Suzuki Mehran has a sale of 14,134 units and while Dahatsu cuore sold only 1728 units. So according to your equation what mehran would be a better car then cuore wouldn't it be? You don't compare cars from their selling ratio. You compare them from their performance, value for money and services given in them. Now why toyota has more sales. Look first of all I don't think that anybody rational would say that Liana is better than corrolla that's a fact whether anybody admits it or not. And selling of more units is because of having the great reselling price and most of all the durability this car is offering, no other car even honda is giving it to its users. Great shocks with good life of engine even in rural areas. That's why its competing. If you look for value of money, meaning the price you are paying for the services you are getting, Sir you have to admit that Liana will get more rating. 1.2 M and it gives you everything that 1.4 M Xli doesn't give and 1.55 M Gli do gives you with an additinal abs, Thats it.

I purchased 0 meter liana in 2008 and have driven almost more then 100000 kms. Its a good car no doubt but it has many flaws. It do has a missing problem. You do have to press race on it before leaving the clutch meaning it needs proper combustion in its engine before you let the clutch go. its a car which gives you great pleasure while accelerating but stops your heart when it comes to brake. Suzuki should think about brakes even their abs system ain't very good, i don't have it but I do have reviews of many who have liana with abs. I was reading a review that missing problem on low gears in cng is pretty much high and he did alot to get out of it but nothing worked. I also experienced it, as I said it does that but there is a point it starts doing it in a very intolerable manner. The problem is with the coils. change them and you will find a huge difference in it. But original coils are very expensive. A set of those is more then Rs 20,000. A korean manufactured coils taken from a reliable source would be a better choice.

Technically speaking it, undoubtedly, is a car. It used to be a good choice until the price went so over the top. It needs a set of certain abilities and confidence to call this rattling box; a car. It still comes with the most modern suspension that is usually used for donkey carts.If you are a complete moron and are unaware that a used car market also exists in this world, this car is made for you.I want to give it a 5 for the 'value for money', but in negative.

It's not worthy of getting even 'one star'. Terrible acceleration, awful handling and pathetic suspension. Getting driving pleasure is totally out of question.

It is the pioneer in sense that it is the only and only 1000 cc carburetor car at this time in the world.It has SJ-410 970 cc 4 cylinder carburated Engine. This engine was made by suzuki Japan in 1985 for Suzuki Jeeps and was used by paksuzuki for potohar jeep (The only discontinued model of Paksuzuki otherwise they never discontinue any vehicle like Mehran).This engine is fitted with a 5 speed gear box which is designed in such a way that its lower gear ratios are very close to each other because it was intended to be used in Jeep. However, when paksuzuki discontinued Potohar jeep they started to fit this engine in Alto. The body shape of this car is also running in some countries like Saudi Arabia etc., but not with this engine. Also this car in those countries has  not permission to come on motorways.It is due to this reason that some people observe and say that alto engine in very powerful and it climbs mountains with ease. It is true that it climbs mountains easily, even easier than cultus, but its power is same as that of cultus. it is just because of gear ratios. i would not mind if Napak Suzuki Motor Company fits jeep engine in  car, but at least they should have evaluated some dynamics. Since this engine is not for car. Due to misfit engine this car has it center of gravity near its center (which should be near front wheels) so turning this car at high speed results in swing around center and loss of control or turn over of car upside down. Therefore this car is higly unstable on road at speeds above 90 km/hr. In this respect it is even worse than Mehran.you can say it FALTO.handling and drive of this car is good, but keep in mind it is not safe at high speeds. Brakes of this car are good. But if you replace its stock tires otherwise paksuzuki install 145mm tread tires which have no surface area to grip the road. AC is good when the car is running at high speedsEngine does not become very hot or hard with AC, but cooling of AC is a problem. only front two passengers can travel in city with AC. It has no RPM meter. It fuel economy at CNG is good and at petrol approximately 12-16 km/l. Door trim of this car are very good made up of entire moulding with plastic which even suzuki is not offering in cultus.Ac knobs are rotary type which look good like sedan cars.Seats are not comfortable but not roasting like seats of Mehran.Inside space is insufficient especially for rear passengers. Body is good looking and compared to all other small cars of paksuzuki it is good value for money.

Bought a silver Dlx yesterday and i must say, Paksuzuki has done a great job to ensure good quality.  The driving pleasue is immense. A noise-free cabin, good road grip, excellent pick-up, good handling and comfortable seating makes swift an instant hit as far as i am concerned. Can't say much about the fuel economy as yet. The braking isn't as good as as i was hoping. I have a 09 city and a 10 corolla gli  but with both the cars lacking alloy wheels, Japanese tires, key-less entry, fog lamps and a quality cd/mp3 players, Swift is a clear winner if storage space and large seating room is not a problem!

The story narrated by ahmedhassan1 seems to be a dream or fantasy as it is absolutely impossible to drive 700+ km in only 42 litres and that too with AC. hmhmhmh. Average consumption cannot be more than 6-8 km per litre with ac at the most. As far as shape is concerned, it is not attractive. Rear side is made in such a way that it gives look of a frog. Secondly, it is not load bearing. Means if four normal person sit in it, the body almost starts touching the rear wheel. No room for luggage. If a CNG cylinder is installed, then 3-4k will have to be spent on suspension to support the weight.  Vitz is much better being Japanese assembled.

If you are looking for luxury in a small package, this car is for you.Engine size is large and power to weight ratio is excellent. That is why even in Lahore heat and humidity, the AC cooling remains effective and pick is not affected by AC.Small goodies that add up to a lot include japanese tyres, jvc cd player, cup-holders, central locking, electronic keys (ignition impossible without original keys), powerful blower in the AC, good-sized boot (one standard size luggage item can stand in the same space, comparable to what you are left with if you install CNG in a city)Fuel economy is excellent. With a mix of motorway driving (120 constant, overtaking >130) and city driving, I am getting over 13kms on a litre. No vibrations in cabin etc till 150km/hr.Excellent value for money considering that for a similar price you only get a refurbished vitz with 300cc less engine or a 2 year driven city, which will start mechanical trouble in an year of use.

Assembling is of japanese standard not of local suzuki. It is spacious and powerful enough to take on long route. Suzuki should bring more variety like SX4 1.6 Grand Vitara XL-7 V6 and  Kizashi 2.4 to have a respectable place in the market against the competitors.

Hi Guys,I purchased Alto VXR cng in Aug 2010, now its one year completed. I drove it 26000 kms so far, was just only changing oil and filter. I am not saying teh car is immaculate but one has to see the over all raise in price for all the cars in Pakistan. Santro is not cheaper, neither the Cuore so over all you actually do not get the value for money but what options you are left with? its the cheapest amongst others with AC in it which is quote comfortable.I changed tires and installed Dunlop ECO, installed security system and seat covers, floor mats etc. Its reliable and never had any problem ALHAMDOLILLAH in long run. I took it to 150 Kms my self and though the engine was noisy but the drive was not like dangerous. Yes the breaking system is not that good, its average. Car do not have heating problem, until unless you fill the water bottle up to the mark full. Fuel consumption is not good but in CNG it goes to 250 kms in one full cylinder without ac, with ac its 150kms in local and 200 kms in long run. Gear conversion was tight but Suzuki dealer changes the gear oil at first 1000 kms free tuning, its better now. Engine is noisy because it has Potohar jeep's engine, but its more powerful on when you are driving it on mountains. Suzuki's over all quality assurance is worst so we can not say any of their model specifically is bad, what we get in cultus liana ? same door opening and closing issues - just an example. Car suspension is good enough and does not cause any noise if you drive it calmly in off road. We are left with no option if we have to buy a reliable family car which do not cause problem in long run, we have to buy mehran or alto, those who suggest to but second hand corolla or honda, do keep in mind that still they are second hand car and you can not rely on them when you are on motorway and surely do not like to face any technical issue with the car.For people who are planning to buy zero meter, I would suggest you either put some more money and buy some more luxurious car like Honda/  Corolla or buy this Alto VXR cng and do the following things.1. It will take long self because be default the tepats are tights, do not ask any mechanic to fix it, wait till 1st 1000 kms, than go for the dealer from where you have bought this car and they will adjust the tapets, starting will get superb undoubtedly.2. Do the cng setting and convert to cng after driving 1000 kms first on petrol.3. Ask the service manager to change or check gear oil so gear conversion gets soft.4. Change tires, general tires sucks and also harms the suspension as they are very hard. Go for Japenese Dunlop (suggested)5. Do the balancing and wheel alignment.6. Do not over fill the water bottle, my car only reduces 2% water from the bottle, DO NOT OVER FILL THE BOTTLE, keep it up to the mark - FULL.7. Change oil and filter every 4,000 kms either Zic or Caltex havoline, or shell.8. While washing, put plastic on the distributor to avoid any starting problem.9. Avoid taking it to the mechanic for pick or cng consumption, let the car settle down for 10,000 KMs, sometimes its cng quality which causes car do have the require pick up. (I did two tunings till 26,000 KMs.)10. If you need any more information, contact me on my email - [email protected]Thanks!

we have owned an alto vxr 2007 since we bought it new in august 2007. i must say car is great on cng.it gives better mileage as per km/kg on cng on our mehran which was also boght brand new. both cars are serviced at regular intervals with good zic A+ n guard filters at 5k kms. alto is a tonnes times better than the mehran and in erms of mehran its value for money. i.e back then we bought it for 507,000 n the mehran was a mere 1 lac cheaper. suspension is good n srt of corollaish. its a great car in its category for use in Pakistan. done almost 67000 kms fault free. gives excellent fuel economyon cng. has given me over 240 KMs on a tank full many a times without AC on long routes despite having 165 yokohamas(707 which are great n replaced with the same tyre at 58000) costs between 2-3 Rs / KM nowadays with AC n mixed locak n highway driving. rear  headlights are expensive and so are the engine parts. but aval of cheaper chinese parts does the job. itts my daily ride n love her to bits. the pickis great. the key to the great performance is regular maintenance of the car n using quality engine oil n filters at regulatr interval with period maint done on time. the worst part is its fuel economy on petrol which is worst than my 1,8 civic prosmatec.overall i give it a 7/10!!!

Suzuki Mehran, is highly over priced car. The cost to product value is way too high. For almost 6 lakhs you get a car which doesnot even have de-fogger. you cannot rely on the breaks and there is no comfort if you ride in the back seat of the car. I hope that some day people in my country doesnot buy cars for their resale value but for their quality.But if you are looking to sell your car before you even buy it, or you are looking for fuel economy then mehran is a good choice. even better.

I have owned the Alto VXR 2005 for the last six years. Soon after buying it i had the tyres renewed to dunlop. changed the upholstry, installed central locking and power windows, changed the music system. Since then i have been using the car for all of my driving needs including 5 round road trips from karachi to lahore and islamabad. having driven it for 80,000 km in six years still it sounds and runs like new. Points to consider are routine maintenance like changing the oil for sump and gear. cleaning of radiator vanes and ac filters. AC service every year. battery renewal every two years. tappet adjustment every 3000 km. stuff like that. The road grip is excellent at very high speeds, the turning radius is marvellous and the comfort level is pleasent for a hatchback. I would suggest alto for every person who wants value for money.

When I bought the new Swift in August 2010, I was disappointed with its fuel consumption. First 5-10 tanks just disappeared.It would simply refuse to give me anything more than 220-250 Km in a tank. [5-6Km/L] It was a horrific experience. At 1000Km mark, got the tuning done. The average was still the same .. horrible!But without doing anything, the average kept improving. By the time it had done 4000Km, I was getting 430-440 Km in a tank in the city. And every time on refueling it takes 39 liters to fill up the tank. Means when I refuel, there is always 4 liters of petrol still in the tank. So basically I am getting 430-440Km in 39 liters within city. That’s pretty neat.Suzuki recommended that it doesn't need an oil change till it has done 5000Km. And since this car is very sparingly used, it took 7 months until it was ready for its OIL/FILTER change. So they changed the oil (ZIC) and oil filter and said everything else is fine.Luckily I had to go to Islamabad so I decided to take this little monster on the highway to see how it performs in terms of fuel consumption. Filled it up, again as usual 39L.We took the motorway. Tried to keep the RPM at or below 3. With the Swift, it’s easily possible to drive at 100-110Km/h with the RPM comfortably below 3. Since it’s gotten pretty hot for the road, used the A/C throughout. To my surprise, we reached Islamabad, attended a wedding in Pindi, went back to Islamabad and next morning came back to Lahore via GT Road. All in ONE tank only. It was simply unbelievable. Back to back, we drove 728 kilometers with A/C in a single tank. And yes, when I refueled again at home it did take 39L only … which is funny. :o)VERDICT: Fuel Consumption AverageCity = 11.15 Km/LHighway = 18.66 Km/L

I have had purchased an Alto CNG VXR in August 2005. Changed the Rims to 13"" with new Tyres. Even then it had the worst braking and road grip. Slightly better than Mehran in comfort, but NOT value for money. Two of people I know, having Alto, faced accidents, pretty bad, due to braking and road grip. Fuel economy is Good. It consumes slightly more than Mehran, still very good for a 970 cc engine. Engine is old and gets very noisy when u drive it for more than 25000 km. Parts are also very expensive, you can ask your dealer about it, as compared to Mehran. I DONT SUGGEST BUYING IT.

This car shows how Japanese manufacturers are taking advantage of our nation's technical ignorance. Despite being a very rich country, they are delivering this car in their country with very smart engine, its average on petrol is 4.2 L / 100km. And in Pakistan they are delivering it with 80's potohar carburetor engine with average 6 L /100 km on petrol. In city it becomes worse as 10L/100km. Thats why Japanese manufacturers never mention fuel consumption in their specs. However, we are thankful to them at-least they are providing us cars that run on our bumpy roads for years. This car would be my first choice to buy if provided with Suzuki's latest K6A 660cc engine. So that I can happily drive it on petrol in CNG shortage periods. And will be good replacement for my old Mehran.

If you are looking for a car that has all the power  features and easy to maintain, this is the car to get.

It is ready cash car and very good sale resale value, but still i bet its the worst car in the whole world, even if you compare it with 624 cc Nano made by Tata motor company india (which sells in india for 167k fully loaded= 320k PkRs) this this meharn will fail to justify its price of 550 for fully loaded still poor than 624 cc nano. pak suzuki is the biggest theif and robber motor car companyAbout the car, it has 1982 G-08 carburetor engine. extremely noisy engine. engine is 3 cylinder so it vibrates a lot in idle condtion whcih feels inside the entire car. it can be fitted with AC but either car or AC will run, both cannot run at same time other wise car will over heat and/ or have no pick to even start from stopped at signal. more ever AC blower is very poor and has only two ducts in dash board.rear passenger are roasted and cannot get any air. i have only given one star for fuel economy and that is only at CNG, not at Petrol. At petrol a 1.3 efi car will consume less than mehran, This car has no safety and a real teen Daaba. this car has no comfort inside, seat are very hard, shock and suspension is very hard, rear suspension uses leaf spring which is only used in trucks other than this car now a days. it has no defogger, rpm meter, trip meter, remote fuel lid or back door open button,fog lamps, center console, cup holders. it creates severe starting problems in winter on gas and even many times on petrol. it has no road grip. brakes are the way very very pathetic and poor. inner space is very conjusted especially in front of driver, driver seems to be trapped between the seat and steering and windscreen, driving position is very bad, gears are the way too hard. alternator is poor, if you switch on lights, AC blower  horn will fade out. in factory fitted CNG version paksuzuki fit Rickshaw CNG kit which never speed up the car beyond 110 Km/hr. in short i want to kill all paksuzuki owners and share holder for making such a car at so high price.

Hi,I have purchased a zero meter Alto in September 2010 and it was my very new experience as my all family members has CULTUS and we have had a pretty good experience of Cultus over all.Untill than I drove 11,000 KMs on ALTO, it gave me excellent CNG consumption even on AC, with around 210 kms in one cylinder of CNG, my experience is its over all good family car which you can rely. I installed Dunlop tires and its grip is good enough now, car's MP 3 player is good but have only two speakers in the front which is not enough for the good sound, I found two major cons in the car.1. The gears are very tough to shift at the start, even after I changed the gear oil on first 1,000 km, still they are not hard.2. Car's engine noise, its more than what I was expecting, but I would like to tell you the reason that it is because of the POTOHAR's engine that ALTO has replaced with his new body, but with more noise, I also felt that car's engine is more stronger than cultus's previous 3 cylinder engine mainly if you compare it when you drove it on mountains.Over all, it was a very good experience, AC is chilling and it does not go to heated up if you regularly (Once in a week) check the radiator water and do not fill the bottle up to the mark that is MAX, try to use coolent instead of water in the radiator, my opinion is that car is expensive and we can get a cultus in that cost but on the other hand, you can see the over all cost of 1000cc or even 850cc cuore's cost has increased so much so purchasing ALTO is just to complete the need of a new car which you can easily rely on, and my findings are that when my car will start giving out work after 2 or 3 years, I will sale it out :)Good part of ALTO is excellent consumption after I adjusted tappets on completion of 1000 kms, comfort and its cuts and shapes.Other than that, one should not expect to get a Honda city's performance in that price which is already very high.

I am driving a Liana Eminent A/T Now a days.Car is not as bad as most mechanics and car dealers say. Low resale value is an issue. But if you buy to keep it more than three years than value for money out rides resale value. Driving pleasure of the ride is very good, interior is roomy and well done, although exterior looks less wider than it should look, so whole car gives a taller look than wider, I personally prefer wider looks. Engine has no issues and runs very smooth, at least on petrol, as mine has no CNG. petrol average is also better than corolla. In Lahore city it is giving 13km/l.

1.My Cousin Got A brand New Liana Just 1 week used.the car was scratchless but the owner wants money immediately so he asked my cousin for car & my cousin said for 750k but he refused & after roaming the whole city he came to my cousin again & asked for a resonable demand so my cousin said that if u make registration of the car then i will pay u 815k & then he bought the car.2. In 815k a brand new car seems good beacause nowadays even cultus is 900k so its far better. The engine is very active & fast. The interior is very nice & its a good car overall.3. The minus point is the resale & some engine problems & mechanics are also a problem to find.

My dad bought liana in 2006, it has currently done 75000 km and no fault yet. Comfort is great. Breaking is the best between non abs cars of the same category. Road grip to quite good comparing to corolla and city but less than Baleno. It gives us 14 km/L in city and 17-18 km/L in highway. Overall its an awsm car if taken care properly. People who had bad experiences with it tried to maintain it the way people maintain Corolla or Mehran. It has a DOHC MPFI Engine which requires extra care and yes Most of the people who say bad stuff about this car never drove it.

Well, I was abroad for few years before going abroad I had EXi Prosmatic. When I returned I was looking for Auto transmission so I purchased Eminent which was recomended by my cousin and car dealers. There is no doubt this car is superb. I kept through out on Petrol very nice, smooth and comfortable drive. Car is far better than Corolla Xli or GLi however one car compare with Vti or Altis but price tag is alot better than Vti or Altis. Runs very good but little heavy on Petrol (May be it is because I use O/D button too much). It is not as spacious as Civic or Corolla (for 4 person its fine) but when you sit in it you can feel luxury and solidness around with stylish interior. Engine sound is very quiet but when you thrust it's accleration one can feel roaring engine with speed which feels good.If someone is asking for buying, I would 100% recomend Eminent.

I got a new cultus back in 2008, drove it for 2 years, thought that its a new zero meter car, but soon (after 3 to 4 months) i realized that this damn cultus cost me about Rs.8,50,000/- with just registration and alloy rims+tyres, you cannot drive this car on original tyres, even suzuki people say that it will damage its suspension.Anyways, if I am spending 8,50,000 on 1000cc car why cant I buy a nice Honda city 2005 to 2007 in the same price and the difference in comfort level is not compareable.As far as the parts are concerned, i can safely say that there is not much difference in cultus and honda parts only Mehran is the suzuki car whose parts are cheap, rest of all the suzuki car's parts are almost of the same price as Honda.Even in the new cultus you cannot have a sound drive, little voices from dashboard, hood, seats etc etc keeps on teasing you and you spend all your time finding these annoying sounds.Anyways, to conclude I will say that cultus is a good car but the price is very high for such quality.

Imported vehicles like vits and IST in a stylish hatch back category had set the market trend but buying such cars were risky in terms of no After Sales Back up and warranty.I decided to buy SWIFT because of its Sporty Style and powerfull performance with 1.3L engine.It may be a question mark to think hatch back in 1300cc that is for the first time in Pakistan. However the fuel milage of this car has really impressed me by giving 12~13 km/litre in city while on highway it gives me over 15 km/litre.Price of Swift seems bit higher but if you campare with other 1300cc car like city and corolla, you will find more valueable features like Electric Power Steering, Power windows/ side mirrors, ABS, Immobilizer, Fog lamps, Alloy Wheels, matching side mirrors and handles and 4door speakers sound system makes me feel cool every time i ride it.SWIFTcan be compared with imported Toyota IST but Swift has an edge of 2 years/ 50000 km warranty.  As far as its luggage capacity is concerned its tumble folding seat option gives my enough space  to move luggage easily. I would surely recommend to those who aspire for energy, style and a sporty driving experience.

Overall Liana is an economical luxury car, general features are some how competable with HONDA or COROLLA, car exterior & interior is good specialy its JVC music system is very good.I used 2007 model and found 3 main flaws i.e. Car body shape is not aero dynamic on long route / high ways car dis balanced over 85-90 KM / Hour speed, might be its due to its extra highet. Ignition coils became faulty after 2-3 years, this is the most common fault found in Liana, due to which car do not run smoothly on CNG & cause countineous missing. Repalcement cost is around  PKR 18,000.If genuine CNG injectors setting get out it get fixed very hardly.Best feature is economical CNG comsuption, my Liana gave me around 180 KM in full tank.Imran Zia  0334-3532504

Dear reader,                       I know you must be hearing from many people about how bad this car is. Well, since I have myself driven a lot many cars and have tested them to the fullest extend possible, I have a little to say about this master car.      The Suzuki Liana is first of all is not preferred because it is a fully electronic car. Ordinary mechanics can not handle the likes of such cars. Mechanics who don't even know what Torque means. The car has to be given to an authorized Suzuki workshop in order to be repaired.      The Liana is also not favored due to it poor acceleration on CNG. This only happens when you use AC while driving it on CNG. The car's Micro processor cuts down the power from the engine to sustain economy and therefore it lacks acceleration.       Why would I want to buy the Liana? Well, it is a complete car for it's price. It lacks a strong body and a good torque but here are the following points:1. Suzuki Liana offers ABS and traction control at a very affordable price of 13 lakh.2. It is spacious more than the Corolla or City.3. The car is extremely resistant to over-heating even though it is a Suzuki.4. It has a very stable Rpm system. The car reacts quickly to overall clutch use and gear shifting.5. The brakes, although being drums at rear, are better than Corolla or Civic. The weight of the car allows it's break down force to stay on track and avoid skidding.6. The Liana is faster than the Corolla or city and accelerates better on higher gears only on fuel.7. The car's overall handling is better than the Civic! The traction control is so stable that even the Honda civic is no match for it's handling.Why won't you buy the Liana?1. The car depreciates it's value even after a month use by 1 lakh.2. The car is only meant for soft handling unlike the Corolla. It can give you a lot of trouble and may need repairs if not handled with care.3. The aerodynamics of the car are horrible for corner taking. The car losses it speed while taking a corner.

I have owned and driven this little champ for the past three years, one year in rural Lincolnshire and two in rural Central Punjab commuting to Lahore, an occasional drive to Murree.For me it has been just what I need, frugal, good looking and more than sufficiently nippy for the local highways. The major drawback has been lack of room when you try to carry more than one passenger. Reliability is great. Hill climbing and off road ability, ease of use in engaging low 4x4 with the push of a button is outstanding.

Cheaper, infect the cheapest 0.8L car in the world.2. Low maintenance cost.3. Good fuel economy in city so it is quite affordable.4. Spare parts are cheap and easily available.<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>1. Very low quality body2. low quality paint3. very hard suspension, causes back ache, 4. headache and makes your car rattle.5.very noisy engine6. lousy brakes but this problem can be overridden by the selection of 165/70/R12 tires.7. car runs OK till 30K KM, after that it becomes a nightmare to drive.8.

i have driven alto for three years now and it seems to be as good as new even though it has been driven for 32000km. i personally believe that alto is the best car among the other cars that paksuzuki produces, in terms of reliability, stability, low cost of maintenance, fuel economy and at last but not the least comfort for its price tag.only one minor concern that i would like to share is the somewhat noisy passenger cabin. i dont know whether it is because the low profile soundproofing arrangement or because of its engine's extra noise.man its amazing for its fuel economy it gives me regularly 22 - 23 km/kg of cng on highway. sometime it exceeds even this, as when i last went to karachi from multan it gave me an amazing millage of 25 km/kg of cng.currently i am planning to replace it with honda civic but guys truly when i think about this i become sad with this thought that i am not gonna have an alto anymore.Alto really rocks...........

We wanted to buy a 2nd car, comparing Alto, & Coure, we opted for ALTO. Being a Suzuki, to me it meant cheaper maintanance & reliability.However we got our 1st surprise when we noted that car started to shake (Up & Down) as soon we crossed 60kms. We took it to 3s dealership, the foreman took it for drive and told us its bad tyres, we took it to General Tyres they said its suspension. After some to & fro visits I took the car to nilagumbat and got new Yokohama tyres, problem resolved.At 7000plus kms I was driving down the main boulevard when I noted lot of smoke from the car, it was so bad that oil started dripping from tail pipe by the time I reached home. Took it to 3s, was told that this is generic problem with ALTO as valve start sticking forcing oil in cylinders. The problem was sorted out but the performance is not the same ever since. The engine has lost its zip, its not smooth anymore.After a year the car started over heating, and you could hear water boiling and steam coming out of the plastic bottle. Got the radiator cleaned but the problem continued. The pressure would bust heater pipes. A friend suggested to get the fan direct, which has lessened the problem but still water over flows.This summer the air conditioner stopped cooling, in fact it would start ok, but after few minutes the air would slow down, water would drip on carpet, it seemed something was blocking the condensor. 3s checked and told us its working ok, I was not satisfied and took it to a small shop, after listning to my complaint he opened the lower part of the condensor and found that the sponge sheet attached to the fresh air flap had come off and blocking the condensor.BAD; The car has just been driven 23000kms in 2 years, you can hear noises, steering rattles, engine is very noisy, heavy on petrol. Body is very weak, bonet is dented while closing it. GOOD; Resale, Ride is very smooth, seats are supportive.

1088, Suzuki Alto VXR (CNG),3," Dec 01, 2009","

We wanted to buy a 2nd car, comparing Alto, & Coure, we opted for ALTO. Being a Suzuki, to me it meant cheaper maintanance & reliability.However we got our 1st surprise when we noted that car started to shake (Up & Down) as soon we crossed 60kms. We took it to 3s dealership, the foreman took it for drive and told us its bad tyres, we took it to General Tyres they said its suspension. After some to & fro visits I took the car to nilagumbat and got new Yokohama tyres, problem resolved.At 7000plus kms I was driving down the main boulevard when I noted lot of smoke from the car, it was so bad that oil started dripping from tail pipe by the time I reached home. Took it to 3s, was told that this is generic problem with ALTO as valve start sticking forcing oil in cylinders. The problem was sorted out but the performance is not the same ever since.

Too costly, u can buy used prado in this price. Such a huge price, not value of money.  No extra ordinary features. I will never buy this car in that price, never. there are many options available in market. How can any body will pay 1750000/- for this small car. No air bags, no ABS, No defoger etc. It is bullshit.

Its economical, spacious, 4 cylinder powerfull engine. Its a pure driving pleasure, comfort and speed. Excellent to keep and drive. But it has one issue, the bad build quality at such a cost. Its overpriced. Have kept the two versions of this car, I can say that its the best in 1000cc category.

I am a salaried person ,I think Alto is a suitable car for a person like me,It is easy to move, nearly 2 lakh less in price than Cultus,Previously I owned an FX and Alto is not very much different from FX.AC is very good if well serviced.Ok for a Pakistani wanting to buy a 1000 cc

1097, Suzuki Baleno,4," Jun 05, 2009","

I have had a Baleno since 2004. Before this I used to own a Suzuki FX. Given my experience with the FX, the Baleno came as quite a surprise because before purchasing the Baleno I had come to the conclusion that Suzuki did not know how to manufacture a decent car.If you sit in an Alto or a Cultus or FX for that matter, they seem to share quite a few common driving characteristics.The Baleno however, is a different beast altogether. This car drives more like a Toyota (people may disagree). This is my fifth year with the car and it has not given me any trouble. I have only done the regular maintenance that is required for all cars. The car also has an excellent Factory fitted CNG kit which gives great mileage both in and out of the city. Even today when I think about getting another used car I feel that there is no car out there with such a good balance of features and performance at the price it is currently available for. About the only downside is the brand issue. A Suzuki, no matter how good, can never be a Honda or a Toyota.

1098, Suzuki Mehran,1," Jun 05, 2009","

 Mehran is one of the most successful model of Suzuki. Its a car that is mostly seen on Pakistan roads. Almost 70 percent of the car is manufactured in Pakistan. Why this car is very popular and successful? Well, in 800 cc category , for a very long time , Mehran was the only choice and affordable too to middle class.Still not too many options available when it comes to 800 cc category. There are some negatives in Mehran too. Its interior and exterior is of poor quality and deteriorates quickly. Suspension , gears , brakes , in fact almost all the part wear out quickly. Doors , locks and seats are very pathetic.THe ride is quite bumpy when driving on coarse paths. Yes , it has a low maintenance expenditure. Plus good support country wide.In the price range of Mehran , people are left with nothing but Mehran. Thats the success point of Suzuki Mehran in my view.
